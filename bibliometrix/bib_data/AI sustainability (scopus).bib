abstract={This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Strategic risk is an inevitable question of reality, which leads to a significant impact that negatively affects firms’ overall development, even threatening their survival. Most of extant studies on early warning models merely take the financial factors into account, whereas strategic risk pertaining to firms involves a diverse group of non-financial factors. In addition, the growing attention attached to the sustainable development of ecological and social environment has raised specific concerns to manufacturing firms, which need especially manage the risks generated from the process of sustainable innovation. However, scholars have paid far less attention to early warning models that comprehensively address the above problems. It is crucial to facilitate manufacturing firms to timely detect strategic risk during the process of sustainable innovation, whereas the existing early warning models are not reliable enough to warn the potential risks. Therefore, this study sets out to introduce the sustainable risk into the early warning indicators system of strategic risk. Then, Chinese manufacturing firms are applied to construct an early warning model which based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The results provide evidence that the proposed model shows a better fitting effect, higher prediction precision and higher convergence speed when compared with conventional models. In addition, the weights of the early warning model obtained from the training are substituted into the forward propagation formula, which enables to determine the relative importance of risk factors. It is of great significance for the firms to prioritize risk management actions. Furthermore, the new model enables manufacturing firms to warn the strategic risk during the process of sustainable innovation while striking a balance among economic, environmental, and social performances. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Smart cities are claimed to be smart if the new technologies are capable of providing desired sustainable outcome. The sustainable properties of smart city applications require less energy consumption and efficient resource allocation. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, and fog networks have emerged as the most crucial researched areas due to their numerous applications for smart cities to provide the desired sustainable outcome. The sustainable properties of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a vital role in the deployment of these technologies into the physical world and efficient utilization of the available spectrum is a major problem faced here. As a potential solution of this, Cognitive Radio (CR) merged with WSN as Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs) make the smart perspective with high resource management through cooperative communication. The proposed work establishes a dynamic correlation between Secondary Users/nodes (SUs) in a single cluster according to their statistical behavior at the time of performing smart cooperative communication in CRSNs to improve sustainability of smart world IoT applications. Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is used to calculate the real-time resource allocation to these clusters using their respective Coordinator Agent (CoA) based on the dynamic behaviors. To improve sustainability in the smart city applications, the time delay in the prediction of vacant channels is reduced which results in making these applications become more energy efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed work is illustrated with mathematical analysis and simulation results confirm its better sustainable performance compared to the existing techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries challenges their sustainability despite the implementation of the various gear technical regulations. A step towards extended control over the catch process can be established through a real-time catch monitoring tool that will allow fishers to react to unwanted catch compositions. In this study, for the first time in the commercial demersal trawl fishery sector, we introduce an automated catch description that leverages state-of-the-art region based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture and builds upon an in-trawl novel image acquisition system. The system is optimized for applications in Nephrops fishery and enables the classification and count of catch items during fishing operation. The detector robustness was improved with augmentation techniques applied during training on a custom high-resolution dataset obtained during extensive demersal trawling. The resulting algorithms were tested on video footage representing both the normal towing process and haul-back conditions. The algorithm obtained an F-score of 0.79. The resulting automated catch description was compared with the manual catch count showing low absolute error during towing. Current practices in demersal trawl fisheries are carried out without any indications of catch composition nor whether the catch enters the fishing gear. Hence, the proposed solution provides a substantial technical contribution to making this type of fishery more targeted, paving the way to further optimization of fishing activities aiming at increasing target catch while reducing unwanted bycatch. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Food access is a major key component in food security, as it is every individual’s right to proper access to a nutritious and affordable food supply. Low access to healthy food sources influences people’s diet and activity habits. Guilford County in North Carolina has a high ranking in low food security and a high rate of health issues such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial correlation between health issues and food access areas. The secondary objective was to quantitatively compare food access areas and heath issues’ descriptive statistics. The tertiary objective was to compare several machine learning techniques and find the best model that fit health issues against various food access variables with the highest performance accuracy. In this study, we adopted a food-access perspective to show that communities that have residents who have equitable access to healthy food options are typically less vulnerable to health-related disasters. We propose a methodology to help policymakers lower the number of health issues in Guilford County by analyzing such issues via correlation with respect to food access. Specifically, we conducted a geographic information system mapping methodology to examine how access to healthy food options influenced health and mortality outcomes in one of the largest counties in the state of North Carolina. We created geospatial maps representing food deserts—areas with scarce access to nutritious food; food swamps—areas with more availability of unhealthy food options compared to healthy food options; and food oases—areas with a relatively higher availability of healthy food options than unhealthy options. Our results presented a positive correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.819 among obesity and the independent variables of transportation access, and population. The correlation coefficient matrix analysis helped to identify a strong negative correlation between obesity and median income. Overall, this study offers valuable insights that can help health authorities develop preemptive preparedness for healthcare disasters. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents an exploration of public discourse surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture, specifically related to precision agriculture techniques. (1) Advancements in the use of AI have increased its implementation in the agricultural sector, often framed as a sustainable solution for feeding a growing global population. However, lessons learned from previous agricultural innovations indicate that new technologies may face public scrutiny and suspicion, limiting the dissemination of the innovation. Using systems thinking approaches can help to improve the development and dissemination of agricultural innovations and limit the unintended consequences of innovations within society. (2) To analyze the current discourse surrounding AI in agriculture, a content analysis was conducted on Twitter using Meltwater to select tweets with specific reach and engagement. (3) Seven themes resulted from the analysis: precision agriculture and digital technology innovation; transformation and the future of agriculture; accelerate solutions, solve challenges; data management and accessibility; transforming crop management, prioritizing adoption; and AI and sustainability. (4) The discourse on AI in agriculture on Twitter was overwhelmingly positive, failing to account for the potential drawbacks or limits of the innovation. This paper examines the limits of the current communication and outreach across environmental, economic, social, cultural, political, and behavioral contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={“Going concern” is a professional term in the domain of accounting and auditing. The issuance of appropriate audit opinions by certified public accountants (CPAs) and auditors is critical to companies as a going concern, as misjudgment and/or failure to identify the probability of bankruptcy can cause heavy losses to stakeholders and affect corporate sustainability. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning algorithms are widely used by practitioners, and academic research is also gradually embarking on projects in various domains. However, the use of deep learning algorithms in the prediction of going concern remains limited. In contrast to those in the literature, this study uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for learning and training, in order to construct effective and highly accurate going-concern prediction models. The sample pool consists of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE) and the Taipei Exchange (TPEx) listed companies in 2004–2019, including 86 companies with going concern doubt and 172 companies without going concern doubt. In other words, 258 companies in total are sampled. There are 20 research variables, comprising 16 financial variables and 4 non-financial variables. The results are based on performance indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall/sensitivity, specificity, F1-scores, and Type I and Type II error rates, and both the LSTM and GRU models perform well. As far as accuracy is concerned, the LSTM model reports 96.15% accuracy while GRU shows 94.23% accuracy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Automated decision making and predictive analytics through artificial intelligence, in combination with rapid progress in technologies such as sensor technology and robotics are likely to change the way individuals, communities, governments and private actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological change. Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Global warming and climate change urge the deployment of close carbon-neutral technologies via the synthesis of low-carbon emission fuels and materials. An efficient intermediate product of such technologies is the biomethanol produced from biomass. Microalgae based technologies offer scalable solutions for the biofixation of CO2, where the produced biomass can be transformed into value-added fuel gas mixtures by applying thermochemical processes. In this study, the environmental and economic performances of biomethanol production are examined using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the modelling of catalytic and noncatalytic hydrothermal gasification (HTG). Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularisation algorithms are applied to describe the thermocatalytic transformation involving various types of feedstocks (biomass and wastes) in the training process. The relationship between the elemental composition of the feedstock, HTG reaction conditions (380 °C–717 °C, 22.5 MPa–34.4 MPa, 1–30 wt% biomass-to-water ratio, 0.3 min–60.0 min residence time, up to 5.5 wt% NaOH catalyst load) and fuel gas yield &amp; composition are determined for Chlorella vulgaris strain. The ideal ANN topology is characterised by high training performance (MSE = 5.680E-01) and accuracies (R2 ≥ 0.965) using 2 hidden layers with 17-17 neurons. The process flowsheeting of biomass-to-methanol valorisation is performed using ASPEN Plus software involving the ANN-based HTG fuel gas profiles. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out to evaluate the climate change potential of biomethanol production alternatives. It is obtained that high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (−725 kg CO2,eq (t CH3OH)−1) can be achieved by enriching the HTG syngas composition with H2 using variable renewable electricity sources. The utilisation of hydrothermal gasification for the synthesis of biomethanol is found to be a favourable process alternative due to the (i) variable synthesis gas composition, (ii) heat integration, and (iii) GHG emission mitigation possibilities. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on economic development. This study examined the relationship between the level of AI development and economic growth in 28 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2018, and we focused on the mediating role of the industrial structure. We found that the unreasonable state of the structure is an important reason behind the slowdown of China’s economic growth. The development of AI not only has a direct effect on economic growth, but can also improve economic slowdown by inhibiting industrial structure upgrading. Taking into account regional heterogeneity, we also conducted sub-regional regressions, and the results show that this mediating effect is particularly significant in the eastern, central, and western areas of China; the regression results also show that the development of AI technologies did not boost the economy before the 2008 financial crisis, but during the economic recovery period, the R&D and application of AI helped China’s economy to rebound. Thus, AI has gradually become an important power engine for high-quality and sustainable growth in China’s economy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the increasing transportation activities, road freight transportation has caused significant impacts on sustainability. The necessity of establishing sustainable road freight transportation plans have emerged for businesses. Therefore, it is important to develop decision support models that can be used by managers for sustainable road freight transportation. The objective of study is to predict the profit margin given to customers for freight trucking in sustainable road transportation. For this purpose, the variables affecting the profit margin to be given to the customers in sustainable road freight transportation are determined in the light of experts and managers. A data framework has been created using three-dimensional sustainability factors and customer-based variables. A machine learning-based methodology is developed. The scenario-based empirical investigation has been performed. Two different streams have been developed. The first stream is based on traditional importance analysis and second stream considers Recency, Frequency and Monetary based feature engineering and Discrete Wavelet Transform for noise reduction. Three different machine learning algorithms which are Random Forest, Robust Regression and XGBoost used for these two streams. Six different scenarios are considered. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to two sustainable road freight transportation firms in Turkey. It is aimed to achieve the best performance for profit margin prediction analysis along with demonstrating that the proposed approach provides higher evaluation accuracy. The benchmarking results revealed the superiority of the proposed approach, which trained and tested the prediction model using the stream of data coming from a combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform and feature extraction. The benchmarking and comparisons enact that enhanced XGBoost algorithms provides the best prediction result. This paper presents a novel approach to predict customer-based profit margin in sustainable road freight transportation sector by combining different machine-learning methods for the first time. This study also provides useful insights about strategic and sustainable development perspectives to managers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Plant projects, referred to as Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC), generate massive amounts of data throughout their life cycle, from the planning stages to the operation and maintenance (OM) stages. Many EPC contractors struggle with their projects due to the complexity of the decision-making processes, owing to the vast amount of project data generated during each project stage. In line with the fourth industrial revolution, the demand for engineering project management solutions to apply artificial intelligence (AI) in big data technology is increasing. The purpose of this study was to predict the risk of contractor and support decision-making at each project stage using machine-learning (ML) technology based on data generated in the bidding, engineering, construction, and OM stages of EPC projects. As a result of this study, the Engineering Machine-learning Automation Platform (EMAP), a cloud-based integrated analysis tool applied with big data and AI/ML technology, was developed. EMAP is an intelligent decision support system that consists of five modules: Invitation to Bid (ITB) Analysis, Design Cost Estimation, Design Error Checking, Change Order Forecasting, and Equipment Predictive Maintenance, using advanced AI/ML algorithms. In addition, each module was validated through case studies to assure the performance and accuracy of the module. This study contributes to the strengthening of the risk response for each stage of the EPC project, especially preventing errors by the project managers, and improving their work accuracy. Project risk management using AI/ML breaks away from the existing risk management practices centered on statistical analysis, and further expands the research scalability of related works. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Information asymmetry is everywhere in financial status, financial information, and financial reports due to agency problems and thus may seriously jeopardize the sustainability of corporate operations and the proper functioning of capital markets. In this era of big data and artificial intelligence, deep learning is being applied to many different domains. This study examines both the financial data and non-financial data of TWSE/TEPx listed companies in 2001–2019 by sampling a total of 153 companies, consisting of 51 companies reporting financial statement fraud and 102 companies not reporting financial statement fraud. Two powerful deep learning algorithms (i.e., recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) are used to construct financial statement fraud detection models. The empirical results suggest that the LSTM model outperforms the RNN model in all performance indicators. The LSTM model exhibits accuracy as high as 94.88%, the most frequently used performance indicator. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={During nuclear accidents, decision-makers need to handle considerable data to take appropriate protective actions to protect people and the environment from radioactive material re-lease. In such scenarios, machine learning can be an essential tool in facilitating the protection action decisions that will be made by decision-makers. By feeding machines software with big data to an-alyze and identify nuclear accident behavior, types, and the concentrations of released radioactive materials can be predicted, thus helping in early warning and protecting people and the environ-ment. In this study, based on the ground deposition concentration of radioactive materials at different distances offsite in an emergency planning zone (EPZ), we proposed classification and regression models for three severe accidents. The objective of the classification model is to recognize the transient situation type for taking appropriate actions, while the objective of the regression model is to estimate the concentrations of the released radioactive materials. We used the Personal Computer Transient Analyser (PCTRAN) Advanced Power Reactor (APR) 1400 to simulate three severe accident scenarios and to generate a source term released to the environment. Additionally, the Radiological Consequence Analysis Program (RCAP) was used to assess the off-site consequences of nuclear power plant accidents and to estimate the ground deposition concentrations of radionu-clides. Moreover, ground deposition concentrations at different distances were used as input data for the classification and regression tree (CART) models to obtain an accident pattern and to estab-lish a prediction model. Results showed that the ground deposition concentration at a near distance from a nuclear power plant is a more informative parameter in predicting the concentration of radioactive material release, while the ground deposition concentration at a far distance is a very informative parameter in identifying accident types. In the regression model, the R-square of the training and test data was 0.995 and 0.994, respectively, showing a mean strong linear relationship between the predicted and actual concentration of radioactive material release. The mean absolute percentage error was found to be 26.9% and 28.1% for the training and test data, respectively. In the classification model, the model predicted a scenario (1) of 99.8% and 98.9%, scenario (2) of 98.4% and 91.6%, and scenario (3) of 98.6% and 94.7% for the training and test data, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Having huge power grids successfully integrate sustainable energy sources requires a smart and flexible power grid management system. Such smart systems have to adapt fast and accurately to a great amount of data input – a task which is made easier by applying modern machine learning technology. Solutions crafted by dynamic and powerful computing algorithms have the potential to surpass human cognitive capabilities. The question arises whether and how intellectual property law can be used to set the right incentives. This paper initially describes the basic functions of smart grids and the corresponding necessity of machine learning. Subsequently, it will analyze the current approaches of the most relevant patent offices in dealing with the challenges of AI-related smart grid inventions. Ultimately, it will be demonstrated that the contemporary discussions fail to focus on practical considerations of market entry possibilities that might be more promising than the approach of creating new exclusionary intellectual property rights. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Nowadays, sewage treatment in sustainable cities attracts more researchers both from academic and industrial communities. Especially, since industrial sewage is normally highly toxic, which could cause serious pollution in a city and lead to health problems of residents, it is critical to monitor and predictably maintain sewage treatment facilities in cities. This paper presents an intelligent sewage treatment system based on machine learning and Internet of Things sensors to assist to manage the sewage treatment in a fine chemical plant. The implemented system has operated for twenty months, acquired multi-dimension data such as temperatures in different treatment processes, operation parameters of devices, and real-time Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR. This study can be extended to various sewage treatment scenarios in sustainable cities. © 2021},

abstract={The ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district has been of great interest because of their rich vegetation types and higher biomass density than any other land cover types, it is urgent to evaluate the ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district. However, the monitoring of tropical forests in water conservation district is faced with many problems, such as high forest density, complexity and diversity of the forest structure, complex topography and climate conditions, and the difficulty of access for investigators. In order to solve the above difficulties, this study combined 3D point cloud reconstruction based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technology with forest type classification based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, combined with a small amount of forest permanent sample plot survey data, to accurately evaluate the forest biomass distribution and forest biodiversity in water conservation district. The results show that the overall classification accuracy of the 20 forest types in water conservation district based on the CNN method is 0.61, the overall Kappa coefficient is 0.59, and the conditional Kappa coefficient is concentrated in the range of 0.43–0.85. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the plane measurement of UAV-SfM technology is 0.432 m, and the RMSE of the elevation measurement is 0.989 m, the effect of this UAV technology in tropical forest monitoring is superior. Using the techniques mentioned above, this study can effectively and accurately monitor and evaluate the biomass distribution and biodiversity of tropical forests in the water conservation district. Based on the precision forest ecological monitoring data, this study can develop a scientific and reasonable sustainable forest management plan for the water conservation district according to the distribution of forest biomass and biodiversity. The combination of UAV-SfM technology and the CNN method is an innovative attempt, and the integration of UAV and artificial intelligence technology solves practical problems faced by sustainable forest management. UAV and artificial intelligence will also provide an important foundation for forest ecological environment sustainability assessment research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 1={Since the concept of artificial intelligence was introduced, machine learning algorithms have been an important direction of artificial intelligence, and with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB), K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Ensembles of Classifiers (EC), Decision Trees (DT), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Multilayer Perceptron (MP) are widely used to carry out forest type classification (Koukal et al., 2014), forest tree species classification (Dalla Corte et al., 2020), land use and cover change classification (Ge et al., 2020), urban tree classification (Rahman et al.,2020)and others by using UAV remote sensing images, especially in forest management, forest resources inventory, ecosystem modeling and other aspects. However, there has been no substantial breakthrough in the study of complex tropical forests, especially tropical forests in water conservation district. In complex tropical forests, deep learning algorithms have greater advantages and potential than machine learning algorithms in forest type classification of remote sensing images (Xi et al., 2020; Carbonneau et al.,2020; Hu et al., 2021a). The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, in particular, has the functions of automatic feature selection and feature management. The CNN method usually consists of a long series of layers, each of which is a function of the previous layer. By convolving deep layers, signals or features can be enhanced and filtered until features become easy to classify (Xi et al., 2020). Carbonneau et al. (2020) used machine learning algorithms such as ML, MP, RF and CNN-Supervised Classification to classify the RGB images of 11 rivers, and the indicators showed that the classification ability of deep learning algorithms was significantly higher than that of machine learning algorithms. Schiefer et al. (2020) used the CNN method to draw temperate forest types in RGB images taken by high-resolution UAVs, which also proved the excellent classification ability of the CNN method. In addition, compared to the traditional method of monitoring above-ground biomass, UAV remote sensing imaging improves the efficiency of forest biomass estimation (McRoberts et al., 2010; Navarro et al., 2020; Ruwaimana et al., 2018). However, the accuracy of biomass estimation is limited when UAV remote sensing imaging alone is used for monitoring such a highly complex and high-density tropical forest (Bork and Su, 2007; Otero et al., 2018). To some extent, 3D point cloud reconstruction based on Structure from Motion (SfM) technology can be used to estimate the overall forest biomass (Navarro et al., 2020; Ramalho de Oliveira et al., 2021), which is more accurate than the estimation accuracy using UAV remote sensing imaging through RGB band imagery (Sankey et al., 2017).This research was funded by ?Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 320QN185?, ?Scientific Research Staring Foundation of Hainan University, grant number KYQD(ZR)20056, grant number KYQD(ZR)20058 and grant number KYQD(ZR)1863? and ?National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China, grant number 202010589055?.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AI’s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmers’ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) will not just change our lives but bring about revolutionary transformation. AI can augment efficiencies of good and bad things and thus has been considered both an opportunity and risk for the sustainable development of humans. This study designed a survey to collect 1018 samples of educated people with access to the internet in Taiwan regarding their perceptions of AI and its connections to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The re-spondents showed high confidence in their AI knowledge. They had a very positive attitude toward AI but at the same time thought AI was risky. In general, people in Taiwan could be “rational opti-mists” regarding AI. We also examined how people think of the linkages between AI and the SDGs and found that SDG 4, SDG 9, and SDG 3 had the highest “synergy” and lowest rates of “trade-off”. Significant differences for some key questions were also identified concerning the demographic var-iables such as gender, age, education, and college major. According to the data analysis, education played as the base to construct a sustainable AI-aided town with an embedded innovative circular economy and high-quality water and energy services, making the residents live healthier lives. The findings of this study can be referred to when the perceptions of AI and sustainability issues are of interest for an emerging high-tech economy such as Taiwan and other Asian countries. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Knowing the challenges of keeping and manipulating more and more immutable transaction records in a blockchain network of various supply chain parties and the opportunities of leveraging sophisticated analyses on the big data generated from these records, design of a robust blockchain architecture based on a cloud infrastructure is proposed. This paper presents this technical design with consideration of the technical sustainability in terms of scalability and big data processing and analytics. A case study was used to illustrate how the technical sustainability is achieved by applying the proposed technical design to the real-time detection of the maritime risk management. This case also illustrates how machine learning mechanism helps to reduce maritime risk by guiding a cargo ship to adjust to the planned or safe route from a detour to a danger zone. This paper also discusses the implications for further research direction. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence can be a game changer to address the global challenge of humanity-threatening climate change by fostering sustainable development. Since chemical research and development lay the foundation for innovative products and solutions, this study presents a novel chemical research and development process backed with artificial intelligence and guiding ethical principles to account for both process- and outcome-related sustainability. Particularly in ethically salient contexts, ethical principles have to accompany research and development powered by artificial intelligence to promote social and environmental good and sustainability (beneficence) while preventing any harm (non-maleficence) for all stakeholders (i.e., companies, individuals, society at large) affected. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={In the recent years, important key factor for urban planning is to analyze the sustainability and its functionality towards smart cities. Presently, many researchers employ the conservative machine learning based analysis but those are not appropriate for IoT based health data analysis because of their physical feature extraction and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose remote health monitoring and data analysis by integrating IoT and deep learning concepts. We proposed novel IoT based FoG assisted cloud network architecture that accumulates real-time health care data from patients via several medical IoT sensor networks, these data are analyzed using a deep learning algorithm deployed at Fog based Healthcare Platform. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to the sustainable smart cities to evaluate the process for real-time. The proposed framework not only analyses the healthcare data but also provides immediate relief measures to the patient facing critical conditions and needs immediate consultancy of doctor. Performance is measure in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity of the proposed DHNN with task scheduling algorithm and it is obtained 97.6%, 97.9%, and 94.9%. While accuracy, precision and sensitivity for deep CNN is 96.5%, 97.5% and 94% and for Deep auto-encoder is 92%, 91%, and 82.5%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A firm's business model accounts for direct and indirect network effects, where the network size is a key enabler of value creation and appropriation. Additional conception of a business network's contribution is provided by a recent advancement of the theory of data network effects, where machine learning is used to analyze large data sets to learn, predict, and improve. The more learning there is, the more value is generated, producing ever more data and learning and creating a virtuous circle. For the first time, this study combines the theory of data network effects with business model theory. The contribution lies in extending a business model's lock-in effects through direct and indirect network effects to encompass data network effects. This paper provides a case study that supports the theoretical advancement and illustrates how this form of machine learning can increase profitability while reducing negative ecological impacts in an industrial context. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Economic sustainability is often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={When the UN published the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) were not yet mature. However, through its deployment across industry sectors and verticals, issues related to sustainability, fairness, inclusiveness, efficiency, and usability of these technologies are now priorities for global consumers and producers. This paper discusses what needs to be considered by both policy makers and 'managers' in order to exploit the use of AI for SDG achievement. AI can act as a real and meaningful enabler to achieve sustainability goals; however, it may also have negative impacts. Therefore, a carefully balanced approach is required to ensure that Artificial Intelligence systems are employed to help solve sustainability issues without inadvertently affecting other goals. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, mobile banking apps are becoming an integral part of people lives due to its suppleness and convenience. Despite these benefits, yet its growth in evolving states is beyond ex-pectations. However, using mobiles devices to conduct financial transactions involved a lot of risk. This paper aims to investigate customers’ reasons for non‐usage of the new conduits in developing countries with distinct interest in Nigeria. The study adopts two methods of analysis, artificial in-telligence‐based methods (AI), and structural equations modeling (SEM). A feed‐forward neural network (FFNN) sensitivity examination technique was used to choose the most dominant parameters of mobile banking data collected from 823 respondents. Four algebraic directories were used to corroborate the study AI‐based model. The study AI results found risk, trust, facilitating condi-tions, and inadequate digital laws to be the most dominant parameters that affect mobile banking growth in Nigeria, and discovered social influence and service quality to have no influence on Ni-gerians’ resolve to use moveable banking apps. Moreover, the results proved the superiority of AI-based models above the classical models. Government and pecuniary institutes can use the study outcomes to ensure secured services offering, and improve growth. Finally, the study suggests some areas for future studies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence in the fourth industrial revolution is beginning to live up to its promises of delivering real value necessitated by the availability of relevant data, computational abil-ity, and algorithms. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. Using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. The study also discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. Therefore, it is important that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of AI and increase the research related to it so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation, infrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={As one of the main reference data of weather forecast, weather radar echo image is very important to the stability of agricultural production. Different radar echo patterns represent different disastrous weather, such as hail, severe convection, and so on. Weather radar echo shape prediction can help meteorologists to judge the future changes of disastrous weather, help to avoid the harm of extreme weather to agriculture, and minimize agricultural economic losses. With the application of deep learning in the meteorological field, the deep learning method shows great potential in radar echo prediction. However, there are few research methods to predict the change of weather radar echo shape. This paper presents a radar echo prediction method based on c Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, which can effectively predict the shape of weather radar echo. The actual data is used to train and test our model. Experiments show that the model can accurately predict the change of echo shape. The quantitative evaluation of the model uses detection probability, false alarm rate, critical success index, and heidke skill score. The average scores predicted by this model in 1.5 h were 0.8223,0.2012,0.6812 and 0.7564, respectively, which were better than those predicted by ConvLSTM and TrajGRU models. The qualitative and quantitative results verify the effectiveness of the model, which shows that the model can be effectively applied to the actual weather forecast and improve the stability of agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Supply chain (SC) processes are complex and have been the subject of many optimization studies. The optimization of the SC is pivotal for the success of a business. optimizing SC usually requires rapid responses and additional resources, resulting in increased energy demand that in turn yields augmented CO2 emission. The advent of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) has delivered alternative optimization opportunities when adopted as a digital tool. This research provides insights into AI application for optimizing SC processes in order to decrease energy demand and CO2 emission. The AI engine is based on a Cyber Physical System (CPS) developed using business activities as defined by business processes. A Monte Carlo simulation is adopted to ensure that the baseline (CPS) model is statistically representative. The probability functions and results of2400 runs are extracted and inputted into Python code to generate ordinary least square (OLS) multiple linear regression model. The results of the OLS are used to create energy optimization formula to reduce CO2 emission and yield sustainable energy in the SC. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The Contingency Outsourcing Relationship (CORE) model originated from the Four Outsourcing Relationship Types (FORT) model; the CORE model is used in the globalized Facility Management (FM) industry, while the FORT model is originally used in the global information technology industry. The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly analyse the simulated case studies of the four different categories (i.e., in‐house, technical expertise, commitment and common goals) of the CORE model from the perspective of the various clients. This study builds on the previous work on the outsourcing relationships between a client and a globalized FM service provider. It further ex-plores the application of this model with the aid of artificial neural networks (ANNs) towards a sustainable future. A quantitative methodology through a survey is used to analyse eight outsourcing strategies for the four outsourcing relationships. A set of revised rules of the CORE is introduced and discussed regarding the approaches to investigate the four simulated outsourcing relationship systems. The study further reveals that an interesting understanding of the four outsourcing categories can be systematically and efficiently implemented into the FM outsourcing relationships through the methodology of scientific Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is concluded that FM outsourcing categorization may help to define the appropriate relationships. This further detailed outcome generated from the ANN can be clearly considered a strong and solid reference to define and ex-plain the existing outsourcing relationships between the stakeholders and the service providers with the aim to assign an outsourcing category to the FM relationship between the client and service provider based on the learnt rules. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={With sustainable growth highlighted as a key to success in Industry 4.0, manufacturing companies attempt to optimize production efficiency. In this study, we investigated whether machine learning has explanatory power for quality prediction problems in the injection molding industry. One concern in the injection molding industry is how to predict, and what affects, the quality of the molding products. While this is a large concern, prior studies have not yet examined such issues especially using machine learning techniques. The objective of this article, therefore, is to utilize several machine learning algorithms to test and compare their performances in quality prediction. Using several machine learning algorithms such as tree-based algorithms, regression-based algorithms, and autoencoder, we confirmed that machine learning models capture the complex relationship and that autoencoder outperforms comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance tests also revealed that temperature and time are influential factors that affect the quality. These findings have strong implications for enhancing sustainability in the injection molding industry. Sustainable management in Industry 4.0 requires adapting artificial intelligence techniques. In this manner, this article may be helpful for businesses that are considering the significance of machine learning algorithms in their manufacturing processes. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={This study develops a multi-objective supervisory control (MOSC) strategy for wastewater treatment based on hybrid machine-learning algorithms that search optimal setpoints of multiple controllers under varying influent conditions. A wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operation was modeled by Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2), and influent conditions were generated in consideration of a H-WWTP in South Korea. Two proportional-integral (PI) controllers for dissolved oxygen and biogas, and one cascade-PI controller for nitrate were used as local control loops. The MOSC strategy identified five influent scenarios using fuzzy c-means algorithms and nitrogen-to-carbon ratios. Then, the control performance according to influent changes was gauged employing a deep-learning-based approximation model, and optimal setpoints for the controllers were determined by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that an intelligent MOSC strategy can identify optimal setpoints to improve WWTP performance and outperform a reference control across a range of possible ratios of total Kjeldahl nitrogen to chemical oxygen demand (TKN/COD) in influent disturbances. The MOSC strategy was also able to accommodate extreme influent conditions, reduce operational costs by 8%, maintain effluent quality, and produce biogas for sustainable WWTP operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Water quality failure is a long-standing problem worldwide, causing illness, poisoning, disease outbreak, and claiming human lives in the urban communities. Potable water can be compromised due to a myriad of physical, operational, and environmental factors, such as contaminants intrusion into water pipelines, leaching, disinfection byproducts, chemical or microbial permeation, and pollution. The prediction of potable water quality has seldom been researched, while a novel automated model that offers a proactive approach can be developed to promote sustainability-based strategies. This paper elaborates the impacts of the aforementioned factors on the quality of potable water using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and risk analysis techniques. The ANN model was developed based on historical data obtained from the water distribution networks (WDNs) of the City of El Pedregal, Peru. The data were streamlined and fed to the neural network to be trained. Subsequent to multiple iterations via the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the optimized performance was generated and passed to the trained network to forecast the water quality failure in WDNs. The model performance was tested and validated against different statistical error terms and indicators. The mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error in the ANN failure prediction were computed as 0.08 and 0.15, whereas the average validity of the network was generated to be 92%. Based on the trained neural network, the degree of influence of each factor was determined through implementing a sensitivity analysis. It was found that water quality, water pressure, and operational and maintenance practices had the maximum influence on the risk of failure in water infrastructure. Policy makers and managers can benefit from the proposed model since ANN is already trained, by predicting water quality whenever new data become available. Prediction results will indicate the level of risk (low, moderate, high) to the inhabitants, thereby preemptive measures can be taken to avoid any illness or disease outbreak. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze how the development and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for social responsibility are defined in the national AI strategies of the USA, Russia and China. Design/methodology/approach: The notion of responsibility concerning AI is currently not legally defined by any country in the world. The authors of this research are going to use the methodology, based on Luciano Floridi’s Unified framework of five principles for AI in society, to determine how social responsibility is implemented in the AI strategies of the USA, Russia and China. Findings: All three strategies for the development of AI in the USA, Russia and China, as evaluated in the paper, contain some or other components aimed at achieving public responsibility and responsible use of AI. The Unified framework of five principles for AI in society, developed by L. Floridi, can be used as a viable assessment tool to determine at least in general terms how social responsibility is implied and implemented in national strategic documents in the field of AI. However, authors of the paper call for further development in the field of mutually recognizable ethical models for socially beneficial AI. Practical implications: This study allows us to better understand the linkages, overlaps and differences between modern philosophy of information, AI-ethics, social responsibility and government regulation. The analysis provided in this paper can serve as a basic blueprint for future attempts to define how social responsibility is understood and implied by government decision-makers. Originality/value: The analysis provided in the paper, however general and empirical it may be, is a first-time example of how the Unified framework of five principles for AI in society can be applied as an assessment tool to determine social responsibility in AI-related official documents. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The energy industry is at a crossroads. Digital technological developments have the potential to change our energy supply, trade, and consumption dramatically. The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study's findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 2={The United States of America (USA) focuses on four key objectives for AI technology, which include engaging leadership to promote AI, supporting local experts, promoting research and development funds, and removing the barriers to innovation (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2018). The Chinese government focuses on AI strategies, the objectives and initiatives of the research and development fund, talent development, industrialization, skills acquisition, and education, regulations and standards-setting, and security (State Council issued: Notice of a new generation of artificial intelligence development planning, 2017). The UAE government strategy aims to promote AI technology in the various sectors, including renewable energy, environment, transport, health, technology, education (Government UAE, 2017), etc. Most of the other countries focus on investing in renewable energy projects, a friendly environment, and smooth transactions from fossil fuels to clean energy.Demand-side management: Demand-side management (DSM) involves using more efficient equipment and reducing energy waste (Faruqui et al., 2010). Load demand management can be made smarter and more automated with AI. In the United Kingdom, the use of AI helps support the power station to control power grid devices (e.g., relays, circuit breakers) with greater flexibility in shifting and controlling the demand for energy in real time. Furthermore, these models are useful for supporting and shifting the peak demand-side load to the network's flexibility during peak hours without leaving any impact on end consumers (Macedo et al., 2015). Possible new services are available in AI, such as direct load control, dynamic pricing, and differentiated electric vehicle charging (Macedo et al., 2015; Ramanathan and Vittal, 2008). Depending on the measures applied to consumers and the time is taken, demand management is classified into the following aspects, including time of use, energy efficiency, demand response, auxiliary reserve (production capacity that can compensate the power system for a short time to respond to generation or transmission outages) as shown in Fig. 6 (Palensky and Dietrich, 2011). How to estimate the priority levels based on energy consumption is also shown in Fig. 6 (Palensky and Dietrich, 2011). The time (t1,t2) is the time of measurement with a 10 or 20-min horizon, respectively, and the country of measurement depends on the billing's purpose. From each duration, the pattern of energy consumption starts from ?0? and moves upwards monotonously. From the bottom curve, the more energy is used, the energy consumption curve will be steeper. There are three classes, i.e., c1, c2, c3. The c3 is the least important class and the c1 is the most important class. The priorities and groups of energy consumers are different classes.The conventional grid is changing with the integration of a large amount of renewable energy and the use of new AI control models. The conventional grid does not have enough capacity to compensate for the diversity of RES and the inherent variability of wind and solar energy that creates a variety of challenges to meet the variable load demand. Power companies and utilities are trying to match these variable loads in order to control the stability of the power grid and meet their real-time demand. The use of AI can mitigate these kinds of challenges and make renewable energy an equal player in the country's energy supply. AI techniques and the smart transactive energy framework will improve centralized energy control centers and provide new integration capabilities for microgrids (Marzband et al., 2018). The AI optimization approach improves the resulting values (e.g., system topology and how it works) and the placement of distributed renewable energy (Shaukat et al., 2018). AI used in the integration of smart batteries is combined with rooftop solar, energy management systems and electric vehicle chargers. AI models support the integration of smart inverters with multiple services, e.g., grid reliability (Zahraee et al., 2016), etc. A large number of AI studies on the integration of renewable energy, such as the design of the load frequency controller (Abdelaziz and Ali, 2016), battery and thermal energy storage for a microgrid (Mohammadi and Mohammadi, 2014), predictive monitoring of the management of renewable energy (Rullo et al., 2019), size of PV systems (Mellit et al., 2009), AI's role in PV applications (Mellit and Kalogirou, 2008), optimal control and design of hybrid renewable energy operations (Erdinc and Uzunoglu, 2012), intelligent multi-objective load planning for the microgrid (Chaouachi et al., 2013), configuration, sizing methodologies, storage options and control of integrated renewable energy systems (Chauhan and Saini, 2014), AI to support sustainable development (Wang and Tang, 2004), and renewable hybrid energy systems (Luna-Rubio et al., 2012) have been implemented in the past. These studies describe that the use of AI could make smarter devices such as sensors capable of measuring large amounts of datasets and making timely decisions. It offers utilities to adjust the gap between demand and supply cleverly. Also, AI helps check the health of control devices, identify energy leakage, and understand energy consumption trends.This paper is funded in part by the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (File no.

abstract={This chapter presents a financial technology Zakat distribution system (ZDS) that uses artificial intelligence, blockchain, machine learning, and natural language processes. ZDS uses artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques, natural language processing, and an inference engine for recommendations. In modern terms, it is one of the most important tools for poverty alleviation and financial inclusion. The chapter discusses the Zakat system in India and the issues in the context of India. Based on a survey from more than 4, 500 Muslims in India, it was concluded that 70% of the respondents feel that Zakat is an important tool to eradicate poverty among Muslims in India. The chapter also discusses the problems and issues in the Zakat collection and distribution system in general. The problems of efficiency in distribution, including reaching the right beneficiaries are also addressed by the proposed system. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, M.

abstract={Recently, there have been increasing calls for computer science curricula to complement existing technical training with topics related to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE). In this paper, we present Value Cards, an educational toolkit to inform students and practitioners the social impacts of different machine learning models via deliberation. This paper presents an early use of our approach in a college-level computer science course. Through an in-class activity, we report empirical data for the initial effectiveness of our approach. Our results suggest that the use of the Value Cards toolkit can improve students' understanding of both the technical definitions and trade-offs of performance metrics and apply them in real-world contexts, help them recognize the significance of considering diverse social values in the development and deployment of algorithmic systems, and enable them to communicate, negotiate and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders. Our study also demonstrates a number of caveats we need to consider when using the different variants of the Value Cards toolkit. Finally, we discuss the challenges as well as future applications of our approach. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda and other movements toward setting global goals such as the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal/U.S. Green New Deal are laying the groundwork for a transformation beyond purely market-based economics toward sustainability and inclusiveness [1], in which technological innovation and, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI) can play a central role. The European Union (EU) is committed to the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which the UN itself has recognized cannot be achieved without a people-focused, science-based, digital revolution [2]. This commitment to the 2030 Agenda should entail promoting an inclusive and sustainable AI strategy, rather than a strategy with a narrow focus on competitiveness [3], [4]. In order for AI to contribute to achieving the SDGs, a systemic approach to the development of AI solutions is required [5]-[9]. Conversely, the SDGs provide an ideal framework to test the desirability of AI solutions [10]. Europe's multicultural character and its framework of international collaboration give it a head start toward becoming a global reference in the promotion of an inclusive and sustainable AI. Sharing the experiences and practices of such a European AI could make a significant contribution to achieving the SDGs. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={University students consume live music; however, almost 40% declare that they have never attended a flamenco show, an intangible heritage of humankind. Numerous studies have shown that cultural capital and socioeconomic profile, among other factors, are variables that influence cultural consumption, and therefore, cultural sustainability. Considering the relationship between several variables, this paper pursues a double objective. On the one hand, identifying the factors that influence attendance at flamenco shows, and on the other, proposing a predictive model that quantifies the likelihood of an individual attending a flamenco show. To this end, we analyse flamenco consumption by means of a survey conducted on 452 university students, using Multilayer Perceptrom (a non-parametric model), a methodology based on an artificial neural network. Our results confirm the importance of cultural capital, as well as personal and external factors, among other. The findings of this research work are of potential interest for management and planning of cultural events, as well as to promote cultural sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence help operations management achieve sustainability. However, in sustainable operations management studies, scholars pay less attention to product design, which can be highly affected by artificial intelligence. In addition, sustainability is perceived as maintaining economic development while limiting environmental harm caused by human activity. Therefore, social sustainability is treated as peripheral compared to economic and environmental sustainability. However, social sustainability now has gained more attention because it is the basis on which meaningful economic and environmental sustainability can be valid. Thus, I systematically reviewed present studies on product design considering artificial intelligence to understand what types of social sustainability are achieved when applying artificial intelligence to product design. This study discovered artificial intelligence can improve social sustainability in product design, but social sustainability diversity is necessary. These findings can contribute to the inclusion of different types of social sustainability in product design when using artificial intelli-gence. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={Segmentation studies are crucial for planning sustainability strategies, and tourists' perceptions of destinations offer important segmentation criteria. The aim of this study is to understand and describe the tourist segments with similar levels of perceived destination sustainability and trustworthiness. Perceived sustainability and perceived trustworthiness are based on tourists’ perceptions of the impacts of tourism development and policies of destinations and are measured as multidimensional constructs. Based on a sample of 438 tourists from Chile and Ecuador aged over 17 years, a metaheuristic (genetic algorithm) is employed to select the most useful variables for segmentation using a machine learning process. The results reveal three tourist segments: Extremely optimistic (Segment 3), Optimistic (Segment 2) and Moderately optimistic (Segment 1). These segments differ considerably in terms of the impacts of the dimensions of destination sustainability (environmental, sociocultural, and economic) and trustworthiness (ability, benevolence, and integrity). However, they do not differ in terms of most sociodemographic characteristics. As segmentation criteria, perceived sustainability and trustworthiness can help when analyzing the effectiveness of sustainability strategies and actions by the public and private institutions at tourist destinations. © 2020},

abstract={Users voluntarily generate large amounts of textual content by expressing their opinions, in social media and specialized portals, on every possible issue, including transport and sustainability. In this work we have leveraged such User Generated Content to obtain a high accuracy sentiment analysis model which automatically analyses the negative and positive opinions expressed in the transport domain. In order to develop such model, we have semiautomatically generated an annotated corpus of opinions about transport, which has then been used to fine-tune a large pretrained language model based on recent deep learning techniques. Our empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, which can be applied to automatically process massive amounts of opinions about transport. We believe that our method can help to complement data from official statistics and traditional surveys about transport sustainability. Finally, apart from the model and annotated dataset, we also provide a transport classification score with respect to the sustainability of the transport types found in the use case dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The need for effective freight and human transportation systems has consistently increased during the last decades, mainly due to factors such as globalization, e-commerce activities, and mobility requirements. Traditionally, transportation systems have been designed with the main goal of reducing their monetary cost while offering a specified quality of service. During the last decade, however, sustainability concepts are also being considered as a critical component of transportation systems, i.e., the environmental and social impact of transportation activities have to be taken into account when managers and policy makers design and operate modern transportation systems, whether these refer to long-distance carriers or to metropolitan areas. This paper reviews the existing work on different scientific methodologies that are being used to promote Sustainable Transportation Systems (STS), including simulation, optimization, machine learning, and fuzzy sets. This paper discusses how each of these methodologies have been employed to design and efficiently operate STS. In addition, the paper also provides a classification of common challenges, best practices, future trends, and open research lines that might be useful for both researchers and practitioners. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The significance of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has grown in recent years. The literature indicates that big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has the ability to enhance supply chain performance, but there is limited research concerning the reasons for which firms engaging in manufacturing activities adopt big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence. To address this gap, our study employs institutional theory and resource-based view theory to elucidate the way in which automotive firms configure tangible resources and workforce skills to drive technological enablement and improve sustainable manufacturing practices and furthermore develop circular economy capabilities. We tested the research hypothesis using primary data collected from 219 automotive and allied manufacturing companies operating in South Africa. The contribution of this work lies in the statistical validation of the theoretical framework, which provides insight regarding the role of institutional pressures on resources and their effects on the adoption of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence, and how this affects sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities under the moderating effects of organizational flexibility and industry dynamism. © 2020},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that has great potential in reducing energy consumption, environmental burdens, and operational risks of chemical production. However, large-scale applications of AI are still limited. One barrier is the lack of quantitative understandings of the potential benefits and risks of different AI applications. This study reviewed relevant AI literature and categorized those case studies by application types, impact categories, and application modes. Most studies assessed the energy, economic, and safety implications of AI applications, while few of them have evaluated the environmental impacts of AI, given the large data gaps and difficulties in choosing appropriate assessment methods. Based on the reviewed case studies in the chemical industry, we proposed a conceptual framework that encompasses approaches from industrial ecology, economics, and engineering to guide the selection of performance indicators and evaluation methods for a holistic assessment of AI's impacts. This framework could be a valuable tool to support the decision-making related to AI in the fundamental research and practical production of chemicals. Although this study focuses on the chemical industry, the insights of the literature review and the proposed framework could be applied to AI applications in other industries and broad industrial ecology fields. In the end, this study highlights future research directions for addressing the data challenges in assessing AI's impacts and developing AI-enhanced tools to support the sustainable development of the chemical industry. © 2021 by Yale University},

abstract={When the successful businesses of today are examined, it is seen that the main factor in their success is the value they give to the customers rather than the production power. One of the most important factors in ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty is customer orientation (CO). In this study, it is aimed to investigate the perceived management and customer support for corporate social responsibility, the identification of the employees with the business and the customers and its effect on CO. Another aim of the study is to obtain a model that classifies employee–customer identification (ECI)-CO levels for employees by using artificial intelligence methods not used in previous studies. The research data were obtained from salesperson working in shopping malls in Istanbul. Hypothesis testing with structural equation modelling (SEM) has shown that perceived management and customer support for corporate social responsibility have an impact on employee identification with the business and customers. It has been observed that ECI affects CO, while organizational identification has no significant effect on CO. The structural equation modelling and artificial intelligence findings have empirically demonstrated that high accuracy practical classification models can be obtained and used to detect and solve different marketing problems. © 2021 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={The present study intends to construct a logistic regression based hybrid EML model by considering nine standalone and ensemble machine learning (EML) algorithms as parameters for groundwater potentiality mapping (GPM) in the Teesta River basin of Bangladesh, including random forest (RF), M5P, artificial neural network (ANN), random subspace (RS), dagging, bagging, random tree, support vector machine (SVM), and REPTree. The GPM were then validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. To investigate the effect of the parameters for GPM, we used classification and regression tree (CART) and RF based sensitivity analysis. The very high (831-1200km2) and high groundwater potential areas (521-680km2), were predicted using nine EML algorithms and one hybrid model. The REPTree (AUC-0.893) model outperformed other nine models based on ROC's area under curve (AUC).

abstract={Purpose: The objective of this research is to put forward a novel closed-loop circular economy (CE) approach to forecast the sustainability of supply chains (SCs). We provide a practical and real-world CE framework to improve and fill the current knowledge gap in evaluating sustainability of SCs. Besides, we aim to propose a real-life managerial forecasting approach to alert the decision-makers on the future unsustainability of SCs. Design/methodology/approach: It is needed to develop an integrated mathematical model to deal with the complexity of sustainability and CE criteria. To address this necessity, for the first time, network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) is incorporated into the dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) and artificial neural network (ANN). In general, methodologically, the paper uses a novel hybrid decision-making approach based on a combination of dynamic and network DEA and ANN models to evaluate sustainability of supply chains using environmental, social, and economic criteria based on real life data and experiences of knowledge-based companies so that the study has a good adaptation with the scope of the journal. Findings: A practical CE evaluation framework is proposed by incorporating recyclable undesirable outputs into the models and developing a new hybrid “dynamic NDEA” and “ANN” model. Using ANN, the sustainability trend of supply chains for future periods is forecasted, and the benchmarks are proposed. We deal with the undesirable recycling outputs, inputs, desirable outputs and carry-overs simultaneously. Originality/value: We propose a novel hybrid dynamic NDEA and ANN approach for forecasting the sustainability of SCs. To do so, for the first time, we incorporate a practical CE concept into the NDEA. Applying the hybrid framework provides us a new ranking approach based on the sustainability trend of SCs, so that we can forecast unsustainable supply chains and recommend preventive solutions (benchmarks) to avoid future losses. A practicable case study is given to demonstrate the real-life applications of the proposed method. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Tourist destinations across the globe have been hit by the worst of the crisis that ensued the Covid-19 pandemic, and this concern is exponentially worse in developing countries. Sustainable planning of these countries to face the unheralded crises demands an approach to provide the most efficient solutions using past experiences, unique characteristics of the present crisis, and existing obstacles and challenges. The present study was conducted to develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model using experiences of different countries in beating the crises in the tourism industry. Relying on its generalization capability, the proposed model can forecast the ‘sustainable effectiveness of possible policies’ in developing countries by modelling the dynamics between the characteristics of these systems and the possible policies. A case study of a developing country was conducted to explain the model development process and its efficiency. Based on the data of the characteristics of the Covid-19 crisis and the tourism industry under study, the model outputs indicated that the most effective and sustainable policy to resume the pre-crisis conditions is to employ the combined policy of focusing on domestic tourism and crisis preparedness. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Desirable performance of sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain plays a key role in health attainment and performance evaluation is an essential element of effective pharmaceutical supply chain. Several models have been developed for performance evaluation of supply chains. The important point is that the model should be comprehensive and produces the reliable results. For this purpose, comprehensive criteria for evaluation of all levels at the supply chain is identified based on the revised perspectives of Balanced Scorecard. Considering the network nature of the supply chain, Anderson Peterson Network Data Envelopment Analysis (AP-NDEA) model is used to measure efficiency and rank efficient units. To overcome the weakness of this model, this paper for the first time integrates the predictive Neural Network with the AP-NDEA model called Neuro-AP-NDEA. The proposed model estimates the efficiency measurement function in the shortest time, results in computational savings in memory and is more resistant to statistical disturbances. To make the evaluation model more effective and realistic, Interval Evidential Reasoning with linguistic Interval Fuzzy Belief degree (IFB-IER approach) is applied. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the model. The analytical results indicate that the Neuro-AP-NDEA model allows for an accurate prediction and more efficient performance evaluation than the AP-NDEA model. © 2021, Operational Research Society of India.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a growing and wider presence in academic studies and this presence has affected many fields, such as business research, which has picked up on the subject, and AI is now researched from a more holistic perspective, with operations and supply chain management being recognised as one of the areas that is most likely to benefit from AI applications. In addition, many companies have pushed towards using AI in their supply chain processes in order to achieve sustainability. The influence of AI inevitably extends well beyond the production line. It refers to all business units involved in planning, manufacturing, transporting and selling goods. As a result, companies will need engineering business managers who are well-equipped with know-how of the technological changes that may affect their market and workplace in order to effectively navigate them. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as decision making tools, providing steps for practitioners to consider before and after implementing the AI techniques in their engineering businesses. The framework was developed considering the barriers, enablers and challenges of AI implementation. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={A key objective of global policies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to foster AI research for sustainable development (SD). In this paper we examine the inclusion of this objective in AI published research by addressing three questions: 1) To what extent is AI research addressing the sustainable development goals (SDGs)? 2) Which subject areas of AI show an emerging interest in SD? And 3) What patterns of collaboration between regions of the world are being stimulated by AI? We analyzed AI papers from 2000 to 2019 using the IEEE Xplore database by: 1) Identifying the number of AI papers that address SDGs in their titles, abstracts, and keywords. 2) Developing a composite indicator based on the number of documents produced, citation impact, and inventive impact to distinguish areas with an emerging interest in SD; 3) Exploring co-authorships at three levels: region, income group, and country. The results show that a small share of papers is explicitly focused on SD, but there is an emerging interest in Broadcast technology, Systems Engineering and Theory, Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Sensors, and Education. Inter-regional and inter-income group collaboration are limited, and network power is concentrated in a few countries. The results could be useful to align the connection between technical knowledge, strategic planning for S&T investment, and SD policies. © 2021 18th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2021.

abstract={This paper describes the role AI may play in sustainability. Sustainable development is currently among the greatest challenges. Sustainability and development are apparently opposite. The current efforts to face the Planet Crisis by separate actions generate less impact than expected. The capacity of available technology and in particular Artificial Intelligence is underexplored. Eco-innovation actions focus mainly on smart transportation, smart use of energy and water and waste recycling but do not consider the necessary evolution of behaviors and focus. The concepts such as Smart, Intelligent, Innovative, Green or Wise City invented to promote existing technology transform the IT market. Most of offers consist in data processing with statistical/optimization methods. This paper explains how the AI approach and techniques combined with adequate thinking may innovate the way of facing Planet Crisis and achieving some of 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Purpose: In today’s globalized and heavily industrialized economy, sustainability issues that negatively affect the human population and external environment are on the rise. This study aims to investigate a synergistic combination of supply chain management and quality management practices in strengthening the sustainability performance of Malaysian manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: A total sample of 177 usable surveys was collected. Given the contributions and acceptability of the artificial neural network (ANN) approach in evaluating the findings of this study, this study uses ANN to measure the relationship between each predictor (i.e. supply chain integration [SCI], quality leadership [QL], supplier focus [SF], customer focus (CF) and information sharing [IS]) and the dependent variable (i.e. sustainability performance). Via sensitivity analysis, the relative significance of each predictor variable is ranked based on the normalized importance value. Findings: The sensitivity analysis indicates that CF has the greatest effect on sustainability performance (SP) with 100% normalized relative importance, followed by QL (75%), IS (61.5%), SF (57.3%) and SCI (46.7%). Originality/value: The findings of this study have the potential to provide valuable guidance and insights that can help all manufacturing firms enhance their SP from the optimum combination of the selected SCQM practices with a focus on sustainability. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Concerns around machine learning’s societal impacts have led to proposals to certify some systems. While prominent governance efforts to date center around networking standards bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), we argue that machine learning certification should build on structures from the sustainability domain. Policy challenges of machine learning and sustainability share significant structural similarities, including difficult to observe credence properties, such as data collection characteristics or carbon emissions from model training, and value chain concerns, including core-periphery inequalities, networks of labor, and fragmented and modular value creation. While networking-style standards typically draw their adoption and enforcement from functional needs to conform to enable network participation, machine learning, despite its digital nature, does not benefit from this dynamic. We therefore apply research on certification systems in sustainability, particularly of commodities, to generate lessons across both areas, informing emerging proposals such as the EU’s AI Act. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Supply chain management is often the most challenging part of any business that manufactures, sells goods, or provides services nowadays. Regardless of whether the operations are mostly physical or online, managing supply chains relies entirely on being able to manage shared information securely, efficiently and effectively. Managing the information within the context of a closely-knit supply chain offers the benefits of extra resilience and ability to recover quickly from major disturbances. The authors propose here the development of a blockchain enabled and Intelligent Agent supported supply chain community that will provide a secure, intelligent, responsive and sustainable operational partnership. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: The role of data analytics is significantly important in manufacturing industries as it holds the key to address sustainability challenges and handle the large amount of data generated from different types of manufacturing operations. The present study, therefore, aims to conduct a systematic and bibliometric-based review in the applications of machine learning (ML) techniques for sustainable manufacturing (SM). Design/methodology/approach: In the present study, the authors use a bibliometric review approach that is focused on the statistical analysis of published scientific documents with an unbiased objective of the current status and future research potential of ML applications in sustainable manufacturing. Findings: The present study highlights how manufacturing industries can benefit from ML techniques when applied to address SM issues. Based on the findings, a ML-SM framework is proposed. The framework will be helpful to researchers, policymakers and practitioners to provide guidelines on the successful management of SM practices. Originality/value: A comprehensive and bibliometric review of opportunities for ML techniques in SM with a framework is still limited in the available literature. This study addresses the bibliometric analysis of ML applications in SM, which further adds to the originality. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This research examines return predictability based on minimized forecast errors of CSR Indices through the grey relational analysis (GRA) and three types of artificial neural networks (ANN) model, namely: back-propagation perceptron (BPN); recurrent neural network (RNN); and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), to capture non-linear characteristics of CSR indices for better forecasting accuracy. The study finds that the BPN model has the lowest forecast error, outperforming the RNN and RBFNN models. The model is also consistently better in using the 33% testing data. On the other hand, both the RNN and the RBFNN models preferred the 50% testing data. Based on the GRA rankings, the US Dollar Index and the S&P 500 index are the 1st and 2nd ranking variable, respectively. For the BPN and RNN models, the study experienced the lowest mean absolute error and root mean square errors when using the All Variables group. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={COVID-19 swept the world. The total number of infected people has risen from 5 M in March 2020 to over 22 M in August 2020 and is increasing, which at the current stage does not seem to reach its peak. It has led to waste generation and various phases of waste management practice issues. The impacts include changes in the quantity of waste, composition, timing/frequency (temporal), distribution (spatial), and risk, which affect handling practices and care. So, the global dynamics of waste generation have changed, and special attention has therefore been required. The unexpected variations in the composition and amount of waste often need policymakers to react dynamically. This study underlines the challenges faced by the solid waste management sector during the pandemic and the prospects underlying the framework to resolve current lacunae. The study describes particular pharmaceutical waste cases, plastic waste, and food waste management, which were all a cause for great concern during this crisis. The combination of virus-packed biomedical waste with normal solid waste sources presents major negative protection and health challenges for sanitation employees without active citizen involvement and collaboration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating technology for the whole society, whether the citizen, science, business, education, government, among others. Machine Learning is a technique derived from AI that through neural networks and statistical methods, establishes logical rules to make decisions and automate processes, i.e., a method employed so that machines can learn from the data. A smart city aggregateICT (Information and Communication Technologies) to promote the performance and quality of urban services related to urban transportation, energy consumption, and distribution, and even public services (water treatment and supply; production of electricity, gas, and fuels; collective transport; capture and treatment of sewage and garbage; telecommunications; among others), in order to decrease resource consumption, wastage, and general costs. The administration of Smart Cities is possible to be efficient through the employment of data collected in real-time combined with the skills of computational intelligence, i.e., Machine Learning and its aspects. In this sense, this chapter intends to offer a scientific major contribution related to an overview of Machine learning, directing focus to Sustainable Future Secured Smart Cities, discussing its relationship from a concise bibliographic background, evidencing the potential of technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the last decade, food and drink supply chain management has become an important part of global operations strategy. The global food and drink industries (FDIs) is establishing supply chain operations across countries as a result of increasing demand, this expansion has created challenges in coordinating operations that connect multi-suppliers, one as such is the financial enabler for the multi-layered supply chain network. However, literature on artificial intelligence (AI) in FDIs is limited, this study explores AI theory in supply chain networks and alternative supply chain financing for the FDIs. This study proposes a new conceptual framework based on theoretical contributions identified through literature, a conceptual framework is established and further developed to a meta-framework. This study explored the set-theoretic comparative approach for data analysis, the outcomes of this research suggest that the probable contributions of supply chain networks driven by AI technologies provide a sustainable financing stream for the food and drink supply chain. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Powered by the Internet, the online review market has grown exponentially, providing a trove of information to customers and business. However, cracks have started to appear around the economic, social and environmental sustainability of online reviews and surrounding processes. The root of these concerns lies in the number of reviews having no informational value. With the aim of improving the sustainability of this market, the present research develops and compares seven machine learning approaches to identify waste in online app reviews. The Random Forest approach shows the best performance with accuracy of 0.94. If such approach were implemented to reduce data waste in 11 app stores, 252,611 kg of CO2, US$ 74,392 and 25,880 person hours could be saved. Having demonstrated its potential for app reviews, the developed approach could be extended to achieve greater savings and improve sustainability across different segments and types of online reviews. © ICIS 2020.

abstract={To survive, organizations should inevitably work based on sustainability principles in an ever-increasing changes of markets. Appropriate flexibility and responsiveness are particularly important when considering sustainability issue and market changes in clustering problem. One of the uses of clustering can be allocation of resources and equipment for providing the highest level of customer service which has been a matter of concern for decision makers in distributive companies. Capacitive clustering is a common method for solving allocation and distribution problems. However, traditional clustering models ignore sustainability criteria in defining clusters' capacity. The objective of this study, therefore, is to propose a novel method for optimizing resource allocation for customers given the sustainability criteria. Capacitive clustering is a technique that has a widespread application in data mining. This approach has been used for equipment distribution, sales targeting, market segmentation, etc. One prevalent clustering method is growing neural gas network (GNGN) technique. GNGN is a neural network with uncontrolled learning. In this paper, for the first time, we utilize GNGN to cluster customers given sustainability criteria. Here, the clusters' centers are determined and allocated with regard to capacity constraints of the clusters. The obtained results in general can be regarded as an optimized sustainable distribution system in which the number of trucks, distribution routes as well as fuel consumptions and environmental pollutions are minimized. We can also refer to reductions in urban traffic, maintenance costs, staff costs, and decreases in the fatigue of drivers and distributers due to the proximity of supermarkets. An illustrative case study is done to indicate the applicability and remarkable contributions of the suggested clustering approach. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2021.},

abstract={Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in variety of areas has encouraged an extensive global discourse on the underlying ethical principles and values. With the rapid AI development process and its near instant global coverage, the issues of applicable ethical principles and guidelines have become vital. AI promises to deliver a lot of advantages to economic, social and educational fields. Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called ‘telehealth’. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise. In order to facilitate further discussion about the ethical principles and responsibilities of educational system in healthcare using AI and to potentially arrive at a consensus concerning safe and desirable uses of AI in healthcare education, this paper performs an evaluation of the self-imposed AI ethical guidelines identifying the common principles and approaches as well as drawbacks limiting the practical and legal application of internal policies. The main aim of the research is to encourage integration of theoretical studies and policy studies on sustainability issues in correlation between healthcare and technologies, the AI ethical perspective. © 2021, European Center of Sustainable Development.

abstract={This paper examines artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable development in China. The Chinese government has developed ambitious policies for global leadership in the field of AI and sustainable development. While China has made progress in several areas of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is lagging behind in achieving the SDGs overall, and AI technologies can bolster its progress toward SDGs. Using the latest data of 193 countries around the world, the paper also analyzes the implication of AI on sustainable development both at the global and regional levels. Broadly, a strong positive relationship between the government AI readiness and progress toward SDGs is observed. When classifying the SDGs into four dimensions including economy, society, environment, and partnerships, government AI readiness is found to have a strong relationship with economy followed by the society dimension, whereas there are no clear relationships with the environment and partnerships dimensions. To fully harness and scale the power of AI to meet the SDGs, the Chinese policy maker should align the potential AI technologies to address its SDGs gap, and identify the priority or targeted areas and design appropriate business models and incentive structures for scaling viable solutions. AI technologies, when implemented strategically and properly, can accelerate China’s progress toward SDGs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Accurate runoff forecasting plays an important role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Congestion on road networks has a negative impact on sustainability in many cities through the exacerbation of air pollution. Smart congestion management allows road users to avoid congested areas, decreasing pollutant concentration. Accurately predicting congestion propagation is difficult however, due to the dynamic non-linear behavior of traffic flow. With the rise of Internet of Things devices, there are now data sets available that can be used to provide smart, sustainable transport solutions within cities. In this work, we introduce long short-term memory networks for the prediction of congestion propagation across a road network. Based on vehicle speed data from traffic sensors at two sites, our model predicts the propagation of congestion across a 5-min period within a busy town. Analysis of both univariate and multivariate predictive models show an accuracy of 84–95% depending on the road layout. This accuracy shows that long short-term memory networks are suitable for predicting congestion propagation on road networks and may form a key component of future traffic modelling approaches for smart and sustainable cities around the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies have recently gained significance amongst industries as well as everyday consumers. This is largely due to the benefits that they offer in terms of design freedom, lead-time reduction, mass-customization as well as potential sustainability improvements due to efficiency in resource usage. However, conventional manufacturing industries are reluctant to integrate AM within their established process chains due to the unpredictability of the process and the quality of the final parts that are printed. Conventional manufacturing process have the advantage of decades of research in developing process knowledge and optimization, which culminates in accurate process predictability. This gap in process understanding is one that AM will need to cover in a short time. AM does have the benefit of being a digital manufacturing process and with the adoption of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in production lines, there may not have been a better industrial age for its implementation. This paper presents a case for actively developing AM processes using ML. Then a method for in-process monitoring of the printing process is presented and discussed. The main benefit from using the proposed system is an increase in the efficiency and final quality of the parts printed, as a result of which there is an increased efficiency in resource usage due to preventing material loss due to failed builds and defected parts. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Research in sustainable development, program design and monitoring, and evaluation requires data analytics for the Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) not to suffer the same fate as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were poorly implemented, particularly in developing countries. In the SDGs dispensation, there is a huge amount of development-related data that needs to be harnessed using predictive analytics models such as deep neural networks for timely and unbiased information. The SDGs aim at improving the lives of citizens globally. However, the first six SDGs (SDGs 1-6) are more relevant to developing economies than developed economies. This is because low-resourced countries are still battling with extreme poverty and unacceptable levels of illiteracy occasioned by corruption and poor leadership. Inclusive innovation is a philosophy of SDGs as no one should be left behind in the global economy. The focus of this study is the implementation of SDGs 1-6 in less developed countries. Given their peculiar socio-economic challenges, we proposed a design for a low-budget deep neural network-based sustainable development goals 1-6 (DNNSDGs 1-6) system. The aim is to empower actors implementing SDGs in developing countries with data-based information for robust decision making. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Both digital economy and digital technology researchers increasingly recognize the need to better address the role that artificial intelligence (AI) plays in shaping the evolution of the environmental, social and governance aspects of development. It appears that sustainability and AI research converge on the features of wicked problems that are complex, interconnected and dynamic. Building off such convergence, this article aims to map out the necessary, challenging, and promising intersections by providing an overview of the state of art research. Based on 541 bibliographic data collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, the findings reveal the increasingly central body of work on green and sustainable science and technology in bridging various disciplines, main journals and key topics and concepts. The findings reveal how such interactions can be necessary, challenging, and promising. The article concludes with few general arguments regarding how to diversify and expand the community of practice regarding AI for sustainable development, especially in the areas of expected AI application areas and institutions. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-modal approach machine learning techniques have been used to examine Hurricane Michael's physical sensor data of cloud cover temperature and social media data from Twitter to help stakeholders and government agencies consider the societal implications of hurricane impacts more thoroughly and understand how to plan for mitigating future storms as these disasters become more frequent. Data were obtained from Twitter and NOAA on Hurricane Michael and used to evaluate the relationship between the social sentiment and the physical data during severe weather events. Of all the classification methods employed in this study to evaluate sentiment, the naive Bayes classifier results showed the highest accuracy. Models of natural language processing have been developed to explain sentiment data. Future events prediction models have been tested to improve extreme weather events emergency management. The findings demonstrate that natural language processing and machine learning techniques, using Twitter data, are practical methods of sentiment analysis. This research carried out a social media sentiment analysis that could be used by emergency managers, government officials and decision-makers to make informed emergency response decisions. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The monitoring of sustainability indicators allows behavioural tendencies of a region to be controlled, so that adequate policies could be established in advance for a sustainable development. However, some data could be missed in the monitoring of these indicators, thus making the establishment of sustainability policies difficult. This paper therefore analyses the possibility to forecast the sustainability indicators of a region by using four different artificial intelligent algorithms: linear regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, and M5P. The study area selected was the Algarve region in Portugal, and 180 monitored indicators were analysed between 2011 and 2017. The results showed that M5P is the most appropriate algorithm to estimate sustainability indicators. M5P was the algorithm obtaining the best estimations in a greater number of indicators. Nevertheless, the results showed that MP5 was not the best option for all indicators, since in some of them, the use of other algorithms obtained better results, thus reflecting the need of an individual previous study of each indicator. With these algorithms, it is possible for public bodies and institutions to evaluate the sustainable development of the region and to have reliable information to take corrective measures when needed, thus contributing to a more sustainable future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the digital era, the smart city can become an intelligent society by utilizing advances in emerging technologies. Specifically, the rapid adoption of blockchain technology has led a paradigm shift to a new digital smart city ecosystem. A broad spectrum of blockchain applications promise solutions for problems in areas ranging from risk management and financial services to cryptocurrency, and from the Internet of Things (IoT) to public and social services. Furthermore, the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is revolutionizing the smart city network architecture to build sustainable ecosystems. However, these advancements in technologies bring both opportunities and challenges when it comes to achieving the goals of creating a sustainable smart cities. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the security issues and problems that impact the deployment of blockchain systems in smart cities. This work presents a detailed discussion of several key factors for the convergence of Blockchain and AI technologies that will help form a sustainable smart society. We discuss blockchain security enhancement solutions, summarizing the key points that can be used for developing various blockchain-AI based intelligent transportation systems. Also, we discuss the issues that remain open and our future research direction, this includes new security suggestions and future guidelines for a sustainable smart city ecosystem. © 2020},

abstract={The use of decision-making models in the early stages of the development of complex products and technologies is a well-established practice in industry. Engineers rely on well-established statistical and mathematical models to explore the feasible design space and make early decisions on future design configurations. At the same time, researchers in both value-driven design and sustainable product development areas have stressed the need to expand the design space exploration by encompassing value and sustainability-related considerations. A portfolio of methods and tools for decision support regarding value and sustainability integration has been proposed in literature, but very few have seen an integration in engineering practices. This paper proposes an approach, developed and tested in collaboration with an aerospace subsystem manufacturer, featuring the integration of value-driven design and sustainable product development models in the established practices for design space exploration. The proposed approach uses early simulation results as input for value and sustainability models, automatically computing value and sustainability criteria as an integral part of the design space exploration. Machine learning is applied to deal with the different levels of granularity and maturity of information among early simulations, value models, and sustainability models, as well as for the creation of reliable surrogate models for multidimensional design analysis. The paper describes the logic and rationale of the proposed approach and its application to the case of a turbine rear structure for commercial aircraft engines. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges of the approach implementation and highlights relevant research directions across the value-driven design, sustainable product development, and machine learning research fields.

abstract={This research paper presents the approach of machine learning analysis techniques on education. For the large dataset, data mining techniques are used to extract hidden information and create insight. We hypothesized that the prediction algorithm and dimensional reduction algorithm could be used on an educational dataset to extract the hidden information and analyze the information to create insight. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict student academic performance. Since some of the features in our dataset are correlated so, before applying the prediction algorithm, we applied the dimensional reduction algorithm to reduce the dimension of our dataset and extract the important features. For the prediction analysis, we used three supervised machine learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Before we applied these machine learning algorithms, we applied the dimension reduction algorithm for the feature extraction purpose using two algorithms, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We compared the performance of these machine learning algorithms. For the student academic performance, their final Examination result was taken as the target value, which was predicted by using the above-mentioned supervised algorithm. Our work shows that the dimensional reduction algorithm, followed by the prediction algorithm, achieved the acceptable prediction accuracy for determining student academic performance. Our result also highlights the advantage of employing machine learning techniques on educational data and explains how it helps to provide engineering education insight for the sustainable development of Engineering education as a whole. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The utilization of a high-volume of treated palm oil fuel ash (T-POFA) as a partial cement substitution is one of the solutions presented to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and improve concrete sustainability. In this study, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is adapted as an artificial neural network (ANN) modeling tool to predict the compressive strength of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing T-POFA. The ANFIS model has been developed and validated using concrete mixtures incorporating 0%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, 50 wt%, 60 wt%, and wt 70% T-POFA as a replacement of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) at a constant water/binder (W/B) ratio of 0.35. The experimental data were divided into 70% training data and 30% testing data. The experimental results of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing T-POFA ensured comparable or higher compressive strengths, especially at later ages, when compared to the control SCC. However, the prediction results of the compressive strength of SCC samples using the ANFIS model are very close to the experimental values. The developed ANFIS model showed a highly-efficient performance to predict the SCC compressive strength. In addition, the obtained accurate predicted results using the developed ANN model will significantly affect the current experimental protocols, especially for costly and unsafe experiments. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The unprecedented urban growth of recent years requires improved urban planning and management to make urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Additionally, humanity faces the COVID pandemic, which especially complicates the management of Smart Cities. A possible solution to address these two problems (environmental and health) in Smart Cities may be the use of Machine Learning techniques. One of the objectives of our work is to thoroughly analyze the link between the concepts of Smart Cities, Machine Learning techniques and their applicability. In this work, an exhaustive study of the relationship between Smart Cities and the applicability of Machine Learning (ML) techniques is carried out with the aim of optimizing sustainability. For this, the ML models, analyzed from the point of view of the models, techniques and applications, are studied. The areas and dimensions of sustainability addressed are analyzed, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are discussed. The main objective is to propose a model (EARLY) that allows us to tackle these problems in the future. An inclusive perspective on applicability, sustainability scopes and dimensions, SDGs, tools, data types and Machine Learning techniques is provided. Finally, a case study applied to an Andalusian city is presented. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Facility Layout Design (FLP) is an NP-Hard, which is related to the optimization of the arrangement of facilities in a shop floor or manufacturing unit to maximize the performance and minimize the operating cost. An efficient layout must not only consider the profit but also emphasize on other social causes such as energy consumption, pollution, and people's safety. These are referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. This paper identifies the criteria for sustainability in a manufacturing layout and presents an aggregate mathematical formulation for Sustainable Facility Layout Problem (SFLP). The paper proposes a novel 4-stage methodology using Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Hybrid Meta-heuristic, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and K-mean clustering for designing an energy-efficient sustainable sub-optimal layout under uncertain (stochastic) demand over multiple periods. The goal of this framework is to 1) uniquely rank and predict an efficient SFLP that overcomes the dimensionality curse associated with handling large data set, 2) use K-mean to identify the criteria that maximally satisfied an efficient sustainable layout and propose an SFLP model that can be customized depending social, political and economic conditions, and 3) evaluate the total energy consumption and CO2 emission for an efficient sustainable facility layout. To show the running methodology a case is presented using hypothetical data from the literature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Food systems and our ability to secure food and nutrition for current and future generations is challenged by population growth, climate change, resource depletion and pollution. The current agricultural and supply chain systems are one of the main contributors to the issues. Transformational, not incremental change is needed to transition to sustainable food systems capable of feeding close to 10 billion people in less than 30 years. Artificial intelligence (AI) is pervading all parts of food systems in ways that indicate transformative system changes are possible. Designers, as mediators between people, technology and the environment have a responsibility to recognise and reflect on ways AI could bring the change needed to move to sustainable food systems. This literature review is situated at the intersection of Food systems, Design, Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability. The transdisciplinary approach reveals what exists across the disciplines, what can be done with AI to transition to sustainable food systems, how Design proposes to approach the change, and which ethical or philosophical considerations start to emerge. The discussion reflects on AI as a potential leverage point to bring changes in the system and on the designer's role in establishing the human-technology-environmental relationships.

abstract={In recent years, assessing patent risks has attracted fast-growing attention from both researchers and practitioners in studies of technological innovation. Following the existing literature on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to propose an explorative approach to investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a patent-based multi-level network model that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as an example. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives. The results indicate that the lack of international collaborations among assignees and industry–university–research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the lack of overseas patent applications, especially the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the leading assignees lack awareness of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China’s AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Recently, with the emergence of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), smart systems, machine learning (ML) within artificial intelligence (AI), predictive maintenance (PdM) approaches have been extensively applied in industries for handling the health status of industrial equipment. Due to digital transformation towards I4.0, information techniques, computerized control, and communication networks, it is possible to collect massive amounts of operational and processes conditions data generated form several pieces of equipment and harvest data for making an automated fault detection and diagnosis with the aim to minimize downtime and increase utilization rate of the components and increase their remaining useful lives. PdM is inevitable for sustainable smart manufacturing in I4.0. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a promising tool in PdM applications for smart manufacturing in I4.0, thus it has increased attraction of authors during recent years. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the recent advancements of ML techniques widely applied to PdM for smart manufacturing in I4.0 by classifying the research according to the ML algorithms, ML category, machinery, and equipment used, device used in data acquisition, classification of data, size and type, and highlight the key contributions of the researchers, and thus offers guidelines and foundation for further research. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Addressing all aspects of sustainability with a single assessment method is challenging. Machine learning techniques for assessing the sustainability of the supply chain in sugar cane agroindustry are discussed in this paper. Sugar cane agroindustry involves a complex supply chain from upstream to downstream consisted of multi-stakeholders with different goals. A system of supply chain sustainability assessment based on supervised machine learning techniques, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree was designed to assess the sustainability of the supply chain concerning three indicators, (economic, societal, and environmental indicators). The application of the system showed that ANN can be applied to predict the values of the three sustainability dimensions based on sustainability indicators and produce rational results with small errors. The prediction results of the sustainability dimension using ANN are used to determine the level of sustainability using the decision tree classification model. The classification accuracy obtained is 86%. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, the cyber security of these platforms is a highly active area of research. One key technology underpinning smart IoT systems is machine learning, which classifies and predicts events from large-scale data in IoT networks. Machine learning is susceptible to cyber attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks that inject false data when training machine learning models. Data poisoning attacks degrade the performances of machine learning models. It is an ongoing research challenge to develop trustworthy machine learning models resilient and sustainable against data poisoning attacks in IoT networks. We studied the effects of data poisoning attacks on machine learning models, including the gradient boosting machine, random forest, naive Bayes, and feed-forward deep learning, to determine the levels to which the models should be trusted and said to be reliable in real-world IoT settings. In the training phase, a label modification function is developed to manipulate legitimate input classes. The function is employed at data poisoning rates of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% that allow the comparison of the poisoned models and display their performance degradations. The machine learning models have been evaluated using the ToN_IoT and UNSW NB-15 datasets, as they include a wide variety of recent legitimate and attack vectors. The experimental results revealed that the models' performances will be degraded, in terms of accuracy and detection rates, if the number of the trained normal observations is not significantly larger than the poisoned data. At the rate of data poisoning of 30% or greater on input data, machine learning performances are significantly degraded. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Increasing urban demand and population growth in cities have led to an increase in demand for developing new ways. Parchin–Pasdaran Road, which runs from the heart of Khojir National Park, is a big threat to this park. Despite these environmental threats, the development and creation of new highways is unavoidable. This research was carried out to study the effect of the road on Smith–Wilson evenness index and Simpson diversity index in Khojir National Park. The Land Management Units were created using the ArcGIS software. Using appropriate algorithm in artificial neural network structure and linear regression of species evenness and diversity was modelled. For modelling of species evenness and diversity, factors like bulk density, particle density, moisture content, porosity and distance from the road were used. Finally, considering that the amount of R2 in artificial neural network method was statistically significant for Smith–Wilson and Simpson (0.54), (0.71) and in the regression method, respectively (0.25), (0.75), was obtained, the neural network model was selected as the optimal model. Based on the analysis of sensitivity analysis, humidity factors at 5 and 10 cm from the soil surface, the actual 5 cm particle density on the Smith–Wilson index and the porosity at 10 cm from the soil surface had the most effect on the Russian Simpson index. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={It is necessary to choose proper methodology and indicators for assessing sustainable economic development as the information becomes a tool for decision-making support of sustainable development policies and implementation of programs. In Ukraine, evaluating the results of implementation of different programs for development is essential as an analytical basis for making a strategy for the next period and a prerequisite for further progress. Certain shortcomings of linear models for evaluating the results appeared during the design and implementation of the strategy to manage sustainable economic development. The potential for establishing erroneous targets increases in the formation of strategic objectives for the next forecast period. There is a special need to choose adequate indicators to comprehensively approximate the factors of economic development and evaluation methods that allow more sensitively measuring the results of management decisions in the implementation of the strategy. The article evaluates the results of the Sustainable Development Strategy "Ukraine - 2020", employing the potential of the neural network method for a flexible combination of a large number of factors in constructing nonlinear models of impact on the resulting indicator. As a result of applying the neural network model with one hidden layer for evaluation, based on 16 indicators identifying economic, social, and institutional aspects of sustainable development of Ukraine, it was found that institutional transformations contribute most to achieving sustainable development. Reforms in terms of deregulation and support of entrepreneurship, property rights protection, and competitive environment have the most significant positive impact. On the other hand, low efficiency of capital market reforms, implementation of the energy efficiency program, and reform in the field of public procurement determine the need to revise the program of their fulfilment. © Iryna Skliar, Nataliya Pedchenko, Victoria Strilec, Victoria Novikova, Yevhenii Kozmenko, 2020.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to accurately forecast the changes in water level of a reservoir located in Malaysia with two different scenarios; Scenario 1 (SC1) includes rainfall and water level as input and Scenario 2 (SC2) includes rainfall, water level, and sent out. Different time horizons (one day ahead to seven days) will be investigated to check the accuracy of the proposed models. In this study, four supervised machine learning algorithms for both scenarios were proposed such as Boosted Decision Tree Regression (BDTR), Decision Forest Regression (DFR), Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Neural Network Regression (NNR). Eighty percent of the total data were used for training the datasets while 20% for the dataset used for testing. The models' performance is evaluated using five statistical indexes; the Correlation Coefficient (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative Absolute Error (RAE), and Relative Squared Error (RSE). The findings showed that among the four proposed models, the BLR model outperformed other models with R2 0.998952 (1-day ahead) for SC1 and BDTR for SC2 with R2 0.99992 (1-day ahead). With regards to the uncertainty analysis, 95PPU and d-factors were adopted to measure the uncertainties of the best models (BLR and BDTR). The results showed the value of 95PPU for both models in both scenarios (SC1 and SC2) fall into the range between 80% to 100%. As for the d-factor, all values in SC1 and SC2 fall below one. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform business practices and industries and has the potential to address major societal problems, including sustainability. Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resources for development are used efficiently when social programs help to promote at the same time the sustainability of grass-root financial associations at the bottom of the pyramid. This study applies machine-learning to a worldwide database of grass-root associations in order to identify which social programs are good predictors of financial returns in the groups. The results indicate that education, income-generating activities and health programs are the most frequent programs provided by development agencies. Business training is not the most frequent intervention applied to grass-root associations, but it is in fact the most important social program to encourage financial sustainability, particularly after a development agency stops working with a group and leaves the community. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Based on the rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), all industries are preparing for a paradigm shift as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to study the importance and diffusion of technology and, through this, the development and direction of core technologies. Leading countries such as the United States and China are focusing on artificial intelligence (AI)'s great potential and are working to establish a strategy to preempt the continued superiority of national competitiveness through AI technology. This is because artificial intelligence technology can be applied to all industries, and it is expected to change the industrial structure and create various business models. This study analyzed the leading artificial intelligence technology to strengthen the market's environment and industry competitiveness. We then analyzed the lifecycle of the technology and evaluated the direction of sustainable development in industry. This study collected and studied patents in the field of artificial intelligence from the US Patent Office, where technology-related patents are concentrated. All patents registered as artificial intelligence technology were analyzed by text mining, using the abstracts of each patent. The topic was extracted through topic modeling and defined as a detailed technique. Promising/mature skills were analyzed through a regression analysis of the extracted topics. In addition, the Bass model was applied to the promising technologies, and each technology was studied in terms of the technology lifecycle. Eleven topics were extracted via topic modeling. A regression analysis was conducted to identify the most promising/mature technology, and the results were analyzed with three promising technologies and five mature technologies. Promising technologies include Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR), Image Recognition and Identification Technology. Mature technologies include pattern recognition, machine learning platforms, natural language processing, knowledge representation, optimization, and solving. This study conducts a quantitative analysis using patent data to derive promising technologies and then presents the objective results. In addition, this work then applies the Bass model to the promising artificial intelligence technology to evaluate the development potential and technology diffusion of each technology in terms of its growth cycle. Through this, the growth cycle of AI technology is analyzed in a complex manner, and this study then predicts the replacement timing between competing technologies. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The teaching of artificial intelligence (AI) topics in school curricula is an important global strategic initiative in educating the next generation. As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform schools' teachers about AI curriculum design. How to prepare and engage teachers, and which approaches are suitable for planning the curriculum for sustainable development, are unclear. Therefore, this case study aimed to explore the views of teachers with and without AI teaching experience on key considerations for the preparation, implementation and continuous refinement of a formal AI curriculum for K-12 schools. It drew on the self-determination theory (SDT) and four basic curriculum planning approaches-content, product, process and praxis-as theoretical frameworks to explain the research problems and findings. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 teachers-twelve with and twelve without experience in teaching AI-and used thematic analysis to analyze the interview data. Our findings revealed that genuine curriculum creation should encompass all four forms of curriculum design approach that are coordinated by teachers' self-determination to be orchestrators of student learning experiences. This study also proposed a curriculum development cycle for teachers and curriculum officers. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Agriculture plays an important role in sustaining all human activities. Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Buildings must be energy efficient and sustainable because buildings have contributed significantly to world energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Predicting energy consumption patterns in buildings is beneficial to utility companies, users, and facility managers because it can help to improve energy efficiency. This work proposed a Random Forests (RF) – based prediction model to predict the short-term energy consumption in the hourly resolution in multiple buildings. Five one-year datasets of hourly building energy consumption were used to examine the effectiveness of the RF model throughout the training and test phases. The evaluation results presented that the RF model exhibited a good prediction accuracy in the prediction. In four evaluation scenarios, the mean absolute error (MAE) values ranged from 0.430 to 0.501 kWh for the 1-step-ahead prediction, from 0.612 to 0.940 kWh for the 12-steps-ahead prediction, and from 0.626 to 0.868 kWh for the 24-steps-ahead prediction. The RF model was superior to the M5P and Random Tree (RT) models. The RF was better about 49.21%, 46.93% in the MAE and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than the RT model in forecasting 1-step-ahead building energy consumption. The RF model approved the outstanding performance with the improvement of 49.95% and 29.29% in MAE compared to the M5P model in the 12-steps-ahead, and 24-steps-ahead energy use, respectively. Thus, the proposed RF model was an effective prediction model among the investigated machine learning (ML) models. This study contributes to (i) the state of the knowledge by examining the generalization and effectiveness of ML models in predicting building energy consumption patterns; and (ii) the state of practice by proposing an effective tool to help the building owners and facility managers in understanding building energy performance for enhancing the energy efficiency in buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Big Tech's unregulated roll-out out of experimental AI poses risks to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular vulnerability for developing countries. The goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of AI decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers. Automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance. Poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by Big Tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using AI to harvest data and profits. Stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of AI. In the light of such risks, Big Tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight. The article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of AI damaging the SDGs. It explores internationally accepted principles of AI governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing AI developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing. Furthermore, it argues that AI governance frameworks must require a benefit to the SDGs. The article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued AI innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles. It highlights risks of unregulated AI causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of AI. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Concrete is the most used materials in the construction industry known as an environmental pollutant, posing enormous challenges for sustainability regarding resource depletion, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, efforts need to be focused on the reduction of environmental impacts of concrete to boost its sustainability. To develop eco-friendly concrete mixtures, this study aimed to investigate the mixture design of sustainable concrete. To this end, six machine learning techniques, including water cycle algorithm, soccer league competition algorithm, genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and regression, are applied in order to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The accuracy of these methods is compared based upon performance indicators (e.g., mean absolute error), and the equation generated by the most precision model is utilized for mixture proportioning. Consequently, compressive strength, cost, environmental impacts, including embodied CO2 emission, and energy and resource consumptions are taken into account as sustainability criteria. To integrate these criteria, six types of objective functions are defined and applied and the most efficient sustainable objective function is used to estimate the mixture design of sustainable concrete. Ultimately, the estimated mixtures are compared based on the sustainability index defined by previous studies. The results indicate that water cycle algorithm is the most accurate model with the mean absolute error of 2.86 MPa. Besides, the quadratic distance to the ideal level is the most effective sustainable objective function. Furthermore, increasing the content of cement and super-plasticizer in mixture design deteriorate the sustainability index. Eventually, 16 sustainable mixture proportions are designed, and the most sustainable, the most economical, the eco-friendliest, and the least material-consuming mixtures are presented and compared based on their sustainability indices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sustainability study of the standard wastewater treatment system is the pivotal procedure in the water protection field. In order to better study the sustainability of sewage treatment systems, wastewater treatment system of straw pulp papermaking (WTSPP) and wastewater treatment system of printing and dyeing and papermaking (WTPDP) have been selected to assess the sustainable level in China. Based on the hybrid neural network and emergy framework, WTSPP and WTPDP were considered and analyzed in this paper. Therein, three types of indicators were used to evaluate these two systems, including basic structure emergy indicators (BEI), functional emergy indicators (FEI), and eco-efficiency emergy indicators (EEI). Through the basic neural network model and detailed neural network model design, the iteration paths and algorithm operation diagram of WTSPP and WTPDP were designed and realized in this article. Primary contents include: (1) For WTSPP and WTPDP, nonrenewable resources emergy are both the primary contributor and account for roughly 62.5% and 53.7%, respectively. (2) As the important indicator group, the environmental loading ratio (ELR) is 176 in the WTSPP and 323 in the WTPDP, respectively. Emergy sustainability indicators (ESIs) in the WTSPP and WTPDP, are 0.015 and 0.014, respectively. (3) Depending on fluctuation degrees, WTSPP is better than WTPDP. The maximum fluctuation ranges of WTSPP and WTPDP are (3%,-27%) and (28%, 61%), respectively. (4) All neural network analysis results manifest that the emergy sustainability indicators (ESIs) of WTSPP and WTPDP are [0.0151, 0.011] and [0.0179, 0.0055] in view of a long-term predictive view, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The aim of the paper is to investigate the artificial intelligence (AI) function in agri-food industry, as well as the role of stakeholders in its supply chain. Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still "open" in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field. Especially, the study has been conducted following two phases: firstly, we extracted from scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and studied relevant articles; secondly, we analyzed the selected articles. The findings highlight interesting issues about AI towards a "space economy" to achieve sustainable and responsible business models, also in the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={With an overwhelming increase in the demand of autonomous systems, especially in the applications related to intelligent robotics and visual surveillance, come stringent accuracy requirements for complex object recognition. A system that maintains its performance against a change in the object's nature is said to be sustainable and it has become a major area of research for the computer vision research community in the past few years. In this work, we present a sustainable deep learning architecture, which utilizes multi-layer deep features fusion and selection, for accurate object classification. The proposed approach comprises three steps: (1) By utilizing two deep learning architectures, Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition and Inception V3, it extracts features based on transfer learning, (2) Fusion of all the extracted feature vectors is performed by means of a parallel maximum covariance approach, and (3) The best features are selected using Multi Logistic Regression controlled Entropy-Variances method. For verification of the robust selected features, the Ensemble Learning method named Subspace Discriminant Analysis is utilized as a fitness function. The experimental process is conducted using four publicly available datasets, including Caltech-101, Birds database, Butterflies database and CIFAR-100, and a ten-fold validation process which yields the best accuracies of 95.5%, 100%, 98%, and 68.80% for the datasets respectively. Based on the detailed statistical analysis and comparison with the existing methods, the proposed selection method gives significantly more accuracy. Moreover, the computational time of the proposed selection method is better for real-time implementation. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Corporations have embraced the idea of corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) under the general framework of sustainability. Studies have measured and analyzed the impact of internal sustainability efforts on the performance of individual companies, policies, and projects. This exploratory study attempts to extract useful insight from shareholder sustainability resolutions using machine learning-based text analytics. Prior research has studied corporate sustainability disclosures from public reports. By studying shareholder resolutions, we gain insight into the shareholders' perspectives and objectives. The primary source for this study is the Ceres sustainability shareholder resolution database, with 1737 records spanning 2009-2019. The study utilizes a combination of text analytic approaches (i.e., word cloud, co-occurrence, row-similarities, clustering, classification, etc.) to extract insights. These are novel methods of transforming textual data into useful knowledge about corporate sustainability endeavors. This study demonstrates that stakeholders, such as shareholders, can influence corporate sustainability via resolutions. The incorporation of text analytic techniques offers insight to researchers who study vast collections of unstructured bodies of text, improving the understanding of shareholder resolutions and reaching a wider audience. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Whom do we trust more, the recommendation of an expert or public opinion from a crowd of other users of the site? Does it matter if the expert belongs to our in-group? And, what, if anything, would change if an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was the recommender rather than a human expert? In order to answer these research questions, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment, informed by MAIN Model (Sundar, 2008), which posits that interface cues signaling different types of sources can influence perceived credibility of content by triggering distinct cognitive heuristics. Participants were assigned to a scenario wherein the expert review contrasted the peer rating about recommending photos for business profiles, with systematic variations in expert review valence (negative vs. positive), expert identity (ingroup vs. outgroup vs. no identity), and agent type (human vs. AI). Results show that positive ratings are more influential on user judgements. However, for negative ratings, human ingroup members generated greater effects than no-identity experts. Moreover, AI systems were as influential as human experts, suggesting the potential for AI to substitute human experts for online recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Conventionally, liquefaction-induced settlements have been predicted through numerical or analytical methods. In this study, a machine learning approach for predicting the liquefaction-induced settlement at Pohang was investigated. In particular, we examined the potential of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to predict the earthquake-induced settlement at Pohang on the basis of standard penetration test (SPT) data. The performance of two ANN models for settlement prediction was studied and compared in terms of the R2 correlation. Model 1 (input parameters: unit weight, corrected SPT blow count, and cyclic stress ratio (CSR)) showed higher prediction accuracy than model 2 (input parameters: depth of the soil layer, corrected SPT blow count, and the CSR), and the difference in the R2 correlation between the models was about 0.12. Subsequently, an optimal ANN model was used to develop a simple predictive model equation, which was implemented using a matrix formulation. Finally, the liquefaction-induced settlement chart based on the predictive model equation was proposed, and the applicability of the chart was verified by comparing it with the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) image. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Different studies have been carried out to evaluate the progress made by countries and cities towards achieving sustainability to compare its evolution. However, the micro-territorial level, which encompasses a community perspective, has not been examined through a comprehensive forecasting method of sustainability categories with machine learning tools. This study aims to establish a method to forecast the sustainability levels of an urban ecosystem through supervised modeling. To this end, it was necessary to establish a set of indicators that characterize the dimensions of sustainable development, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals. Using the data normalization technique to process the information and combining it in different dimensions made it possible to identify the sustainability level of the urban zone for each year from 2009 to 2017. The resulting information was the basis for the supervised classification. It was found that the sustainability level in the micro-territory has been improving from a low level in 2009, which increased to a medium level in the subsequent years. Forecasts of the sustainability levels of the zone were possible by using decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, in which 70% of the data were used to train the machine learning tools, with the remaining 30% used for validation. According to the performance metrics, decision trees outperformed the other two tools. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Sustainability of food consumption requires the understanding of multi-dimensional environmental, economic and social impacts using a holistic and integrated sustainability assessment and modeling framework. This article presents a novel method on the assessment and modeling of sustainability impacts of food consumption. First, sustainability impacts of food consumption categories are quantified using high sector resolution input-output tables of U.S. economy. Later, an integrated sustainability modeling framework based on two supervised machine-learning techniques such as k-means clustering and logistics regression is presented. The proposed framework involves five steps: (1) economic input-output life cycle sustainability assessment, (2) non-dimensional normalization, (3) sustainability performance evaluation, (4) centroid-based clustering analysis, and (5) sustainability impact modeling. The findings show that the supply chains of food production sectors are accounted for major environmental impacts with higher than 80% of portions for total carbon footprints. Animal slaughtering, rendering, and processing is found as the most dominant sector in most of the environmental impact categories. The logistic model results revealed an overall model accuracy equal to 91.67%. Furthermore, among all the environmental sustainability indicators, it has found that CO and SO2 are the most significant contributors. The results also show that 13.7% of the food and beverage sectors are clustered as high, in which the bread and bakery product manufacturing is the central sector. The large value of the variance (5.24) is attributed to the large total weighted impact value of the animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing cluster. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Risk managers and investors have increasingly been seeking high-quality environment, social and governance (ESG) data in order to assess nonfinancial risks as well as allocate capital towards companies that manage themselves in a ‘socially responsible’ way and adhere to their contract with society. The problem is that due to the lack of agreed-upon standards for companies to use for reporting on sustainability issues, there is a paucity of high-quality firm-level data to serve as key inputs in assessing a company’s risks and adherence to ESG criteria. Big Data, developed through cutting-edge statistical models, artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) covering dozens of languages, provides the solution for ESG rankings and ratings and can help combat self-reported bias and ‘greenwashing’ and provide high-quality data. The ŉext generation’ measures of firms ‘doing good’ are the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs), which are this decade’s benchmarks against which millennials and many investors are beginning to assess companies. The SDGs go beyond the more narrowly focused set of sustainability issues embedded in ESGs, and quality data to measure performance against the SDGs are even more sparse. Using Big Data, Global AI Corporation uncovers data measuring companies’ and counties’ performance on all 17 SDGs, which can enable the integration of SDG factors into investment, risk management and national policy decision-making processes. Big Data is providing statistical indicators and performance metrics data to national governments and the United Nations to benchmark progress towards achieving the SDGs. It is also producing the SDG footprint of the private sector at the regional and global levels for policy purposes as shown in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) SDG Pulse publication. Using Big Data, Global AI Corporation eliminates self-reporting biases and uncovers hidden data, which results in negative as well as positive ESG/SDG scores, while the self-reporting data only produces positive scores. © Henry Stewart Publications 1752-8887 (2020).},

abstract={This work was developed to implement and apply a theatre playwriting technique for an art-based research in the domain of social sustainability of artificial intelligence and robotization. The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a “learning by heart”, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of “The Wizard of RobOz”, inspired by Baum's novel, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a “society 5.0”, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists. In parallel, this play allowed to apply an open source robot design, building and programming for theatrical purpose. The large participation of public to the representation showed the potentiality to transfer this playwriting technique into the domains of new education and communication projects. However, it would be recommended to integrate, within the research and meaning-making process, the other dimensions of sustainability, as well as a relevant presence of ethical reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 1={This theatre play has been realized thanks to the financial support of the Order of Engineers of Turin's Province. The theatre play writing and its representation was realized thanks to the active work of the following persons: Luca Gioppo (Order of Engineers of Turin's Province); Davide Allena (director of the theatre play); Francesca Puopolo and Nathalie Bernardi (text writers ? the former was also the Tin Woodsman voice, while the latter played also the role of Dorothy); Golden Power (acrobatic duo); Alberto Giorgi and Laura Giorgi (steampunk style illusionist); Marco Casazza (environmental physicist and violin player ? sustainability-related analysis and violin player during the performance); Paolo Mosele (support to music composition and arrangements); Paolo Carta (sand drawing); Sara Renesto, Chiara Cardini and Alice Aquino (modern dancers/illusionists); Laura Scaringella (classical dancer); Roberta Bacciolo and Gianni Agnolon (singers); Giulio Evangelista e Daniela Magnetti (hip-hop dancers). Marco Casazza specifically developed the components of research about sustainability and art-based research methods. Luca Gioppo managed all the working process, including the group works, as well as the components of public engagement, focusing also on the role of enterprises social responsibility and the need of the role of a professional guidance as third external neutral arbiter for ethical technological design decisions.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly opening up a new frontier in the fields of business, corporate practices, and governmental policy. The intelligence of machines and robotics with deep learning capabilities have created profound disrupting and enabling impacts on business, governments, and society. They are also influencing the larger trends in global sustainability. As the AI revolution transforms our world, it could herald a utopian future where humanity co-exists harmoniously with machines, or portend a dystopian world filled with conflict, poverty and suffering. More immediately, would AI accelerate our progress on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or bring us further down the path toward greater economic uncertainty, environmental collapse, and social upheaval? What are some of the implications for business leadership and the education of future business leaders? This article aims to address these questions by analyzing the impacts of AI in three case studies. It draws some preliminary inferences for management education and the business of leading corporations in the midst of rapid technological and social change. This study combines the perspectives of business strategy and public policy to analyze the impacts of AI on sustainable development with a specific focus on the advancement of the SDGs. It also draws some lessons on managerial learning and leadership development for global sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There has been increased interest in studying how big data analytics capability (BDAC) and artificial intelligence capability (AIC) lead to sustainable innovation and performance. Yet, few studies have investigated how these two emerging capabilities affect the success of sustainability development projects through the mediating effects of the sustainability design and commercialization processes. Based on Day and Wensley's theoretical framework for diagnosing competitive superiority, we propose a research model to investigate how sustainability design and commercialization mediate the relationships between two emerging capabilities and sustainable growth and performance. To test the proposed research model, we collected empirical data from 905 sustainability development projects from China and the United States. This study makes theoretical and managerial contributions to sustainable development theory. The study findings reveal several interesting results. First, BDAC and AIC not only increase the proficiency of sustainability design and commercialization but also directly enhance sustainable growth and performance. Second, sustainability design and commercialization mediate the positive effects of BDAC and AIC on sustainable growth and performance. Finally, the empirical analyses uncovered several cross-national differences. For sustainability design, BDAC is more important than AIC in the United States, while AIC is more important than BDAC in China. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={A growing number of electricity utilities use machine learning-based outage prediction models (OPMs) to predict the impact of storms on their networks for sustainable management. The accuracy of OPM predictions is sensitive to sample size and event severity representativeness in the training dataset, the extent of which has not yet been quantified. This study devised a randomized and out-of-sample validation experiment to quantify an OPM's prediction uncertainty to different training sample sizes and event severity representativeness. The study showed random error decreasing by more than 100% for sample sizes ranging from 10 to 80 extratropical events, and by 32% for sample sizes from 10 to 40 thunderstorms. This study quantified the minimum number of sample size for the OPM attaining an acceptable prediction performance. The results demonstrated that conditioning the training of the OPM to a subset of events representative of the predicted event's severity reduced the underestimation bias exhibited in high-impact events and the overestimation bias in low-impact ones. We used cross entropy (CE) to quantify the relatedness of weather variable distribution between the training dataset and the forecasted event. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to design a novel custom power demand forecasting algorithm based on the LSTM Deep-Learning method regarding the recent power demand patterns. We performed tests to verify the error rates of the forecasting module, and to confirm the sudden change of power patterns in the actual power demand monitoring system. We collected the power usage data in every five-minute resolution in a day from some groups of the residential, public offices, hospitals, and industrial factories buildings in one year. In order to grasp the external factors and to predict the power demand of each facility, a comparative experiment was conducted in three ways; short-term, long-term, seasonal forecasting experiments. The seasonal patterns of power demand usages were analyzed regarding the residential building. The overall error rates of power demand forecasting using the proposed LSTM module were reduced in terms of each facility. The predicted power demand data shows a certain pattern according to each facility. Especially, the forecasting difference of the residential seasonal forecasting pattern in summer and winter was very different from other seasons. It is possible to reduce unnecessary demand management costs by the designed accurate forecasting method. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Based on the collected weather data from the agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) system, changes in the weather can be obtained in advance, which is an effective way to plan and control sustainable agricultural production. However, it is not easy to accurately predict the future trend because the data always contain complex nonlinear relationship with multiple components. To increase the prediction performance of the weather data in the precision agriculture IoT system, this study used a deep learning predictor with sequential two-level decomposition structure, in which the weather data were decomposed into four components serially, then the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks were trained as the sub-predictors for each component. Finally, the results from GRUs were combined to obtain the medium- and long-term prediction result. The experiments were verified for the proposed model based on weather data from the IoT system in Ningxia, China, for wolfberry planting, in which the prediction results showed that the proposed predictor can obtain the accurate prediction of temperature and humidity and meet the needs of precision agricultural production. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated into many fields. How to construct strategic human resources management practices under the background of AI technology has gained great attentions from many researchers in the world. Consequently, the conception of human resource department's client relationship management (HRDCRM) has been put forward. HRDCRM is a focus topic in the practice areas of strategic human resource management. This paper introduced relational capital as a mediating variable and collected two-wave lagged data (N = 235) from the enterprises located in eastern and southern China to conduct an empirical research on relational capital's mediate role by which HRDCRM influences sustainable enterprise performance. Empirical results reveal that under the control of enterprise's ownership and lifecycle-stage, relational capital plays a partial mediate role in the influence of HRDCRM on sustainable enterprise performance. Therefore, the key to improving sustainable enterprise performance is developing the level of HRDCRM and promoting harmonious development between HRDCRM and relational capital. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Since the number of bicycles is critical to the sustainable development of dockless PBS, this research practiced the introduction of a machine learning approach to quantity management using OFO bike operation data in Shenzhen. First, two clustering algorithms were used to identify the bicycle gathering area, and the available bike number and coefficient of available bike number variation were analyzed in each bicycle gathering area’s type. Second, five classification algorithms were compared in the accuracy of distinguishing the type of bicycle gathering areas using 25 impact factors. Finally, the application of the knowledge gained from the existing dockless bicycle operation data to guide the number planning and management of public bicycles was explored. We found the following. (1) There were 492 OFO bicycle gathering areas that can be divided into four types: high inefficient, normal inefficient, high efficient, and normal efficient. The high inefficient and normal inefficient areas gathered about 110,000 bicycles with low usage. (2) More types of bicycle gathering area will affect the accuracy of the classification algorithm. The random forest classification had the best performance in identifying bicycle gathering area types in five classification algorithms with an accuracy of more than 75%. (3) There were obvious differences in the characteristics of 25 impact factors in four types of bicycle gathering areas. It is feasible to use these factors to predict area type to optimize the number of available bicycles, reduce operating costs, and improve utilization efficiency. This work helps operators and government understand the characteristics of dockless PBS and contributes to promoting long-term sustainable development of the system through a machine learning approach.

abstract={In this paper, the author discusses the need to elevate sustainability to the scrutiny of the Board. Coronavirus disease-2019 and the lessons learned must nudge corporations to think and act more holistically about sustainability and incorporate sustainability into the fabric of the organisation. Each Board Committee must do its part in ensuring the company adopts a robust framework around sustainability. Equally important to reporting on sustainability issues and measuring and managing sustainability risk, is measuring and analysing a company’s sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Key Board Committees all need to understand the impact global macro systemic risks can have on the company and the impact the company can have on externalities which can affect its sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Boards need to ensure that every strategic decision is made through a sustainability lens. Not only will this enhance its societal impact but can be a key driver of performance. A strategic focus on sustainability at the Board level can be a source of competitive advantage. Boards need to measure and understand their sustainability ‘reputational footprint’ and benchmark themselves against their peers. Using big data and artificial intelligence, a corporate Board could integrate sustainability data into its business model and strategic decisions to give it a competitive advantage vs its peers. Boards need to have sufficient fluency in the latest sustainability technology to apply advanced statistical, data-driven information to optimise their sustainability ‘reputational footprint,’ which lowers their cost of capital and improves other financial metrics. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

abstract={The shipping industry faces a significant challenge as it needs to significantly lower the amounts of Green House Gas emissions at the same time as it is expected to meet the rising demand. Traditionally, optimising the fuel consumption for ships is done during the ship design stage and through operating it in a better way, for example, with more energy-efficient machinery, optimising the speed or route. During the last decade, the area of machine learning has evolved significantly, and these methods are applicable in many more fields than before. The field of ship efficiency improvement by using Machine Learning methods is significantly progressing due to the available volumes of data from online measuring, experiments and computations. This amount of data has made machine learning a powerful tool that has been successfully used to extract information and intricate patterns that can be translated into attractive ship energy savings. This article presents an overview of machine learning, current developments, and emerging opportunities for ship efficiency. This article covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning and discusses the methodologies available for ship efficiency optimisation. Besides, this article reveals the potentials of this promising technology and future challenges. Copyright © 2020 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME).},

abstract={Sustainable decisions can be thwarted by a plethora of conflicting influences and information, yet the need to prioritise sustainability in management has never been greater. In an era of high- and ultra-high dimensional data, deep learning models offer the scalability required to extract good representations of significant features from raw data. With automatic learning at several levels of abstraction, deep learning can support sustainable asset management by learning complex functions mapping of systems. By processing data directly from input to output, clear and concise information can support visionary asset management whilst exposing hidden insights, detecting anomalies or predicting future states. This research will look at the necessity of applying deep learning in sustainable asset management and reveal some of the challenges that exist. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This chapter aims to shed light on the pivotal role played by artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting sustainable business models’ development. To achieve this objective, the chapter starts by illustrating relevant previous studies about sustainable business models with a specific focus on the economic, social, and environmental (ESG) dimensions of sustainability and by briefly exploring the literature about AI and its potential impacts on business models. Subsequently, the chapter deepens the investigation by developing specific subsections about the implications of adopting AI for each ESG dimension. Each subsection provides an explicative example illustrating how a multinational company (each located in a different country—the United States, Spain, Italy) has implemented AI techniques toward sustainability performance. These examples provide an empirical view and yield insights about sustainable business models’ development, driving general implications for practitioners. The study also illustrates future research opportunities for academics about the link between sustainability and artificial intelligence. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis of rapid scripts similar solo verdicts then evaluations obtainable arranged dissimilar social networking spots stands stimulating since the partial relative statistics. Created on the views and ideas existing, emerging a Corporate Social Responsibility Report is a stimulating idea, which comprises policies that syndicate the minor script content with previous data. In this paper, a method called HCI-with Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis is projected. The developed HCI-with Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis prescribes the spots which are close to the client’s present area through dissecting the various surveys then subsequently figuring the score esteems. Deep Learning is utilized to streamline the suggestions relying upon the assessment investigation performed on the various surveys, which are taken from various long-range interpersonal communication areas. The Experimentations achieved that the HCI with Deep-learning Sentiment Analysis advance the conduct through expanding the exactness of the supposition examination, thus produces better suggestions, the client then along these lines distinguishes a specific position according to the necessity of the client need. The exhibition of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report is improved utilizing recursive technique and Z-Value that help the client toward recognize an exact spot according to the necessity. The exploratory outcomes got demonstrates the absolute number of online lives specifies (passages of client produced content from the Internet) caught during this period added up to 587,000, while the quantity of CSR-related notices spoke to 20,000 of the sums, or about 4.6%. An extra information inducement was performed over a six-month time span and investigation demonstrated that the proportion of CSR related notices to the complete number of notices stayed steady at roughly 4.6%. Honda exceed the CSR parameter performance than other vendors like Volkswagen, Toyota and Fiat. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Nowadays, sustainable development is considered a key concept and solution in creating a promising and prosperous future for human societies. Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={This study explores the role of deep learning technology in the sustainable development of the music production industry This article surveys the opinions of Taiwanese music creation professionals and uses partial least squares (PLS) regression to analyze and elucidate the importance of deep learning technology in the music production industry. We found that deep learning cannot replace human creativity, but greater investment in this technology can improve the quality of music creation. In order to achieve sustainable development in the music production industry industry participants need to awaken consumers' awareness of music quality, actively enhance the unique value of their art, and strengthen cooperation between industries to provide a friendly environment for listeners. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The growing use of ICT in the workplace has meant that the labor market demands new skills and digital capabilities, either in the production of goods and services or in the need for workers with complementary skills. Concerns about unequal access to new technologies, integrated within the concept of digital divide, has been a topic of study since the use of the Internet began to be generalized among the population. Traditionally, research into the inequalities arising from the emergence of digital technologies has incorporated socioeconomic variables, especially gender, age, educational level, income, and habitat. This study uses advanced data analysis techniques to analyze the main socioeconomic digital skills drivers of the Spanish population. This information allows us to identify whether the population has training needs in relation to their digital competences, which will have a positive influence on improving the level of sustainable development of the country. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nowadays, sustainability is recognized as one of the most important development paradigms and included in the international and national strategies of almost all organizations. Sustainability assessment methods have been important for monitoring sustainability performance. These methods are developed to help decision-makers in their attempts to make society more sustainable. Various methods have been proposed for assessing the sustainability performance, however, this research is the first attempt to employ fuzzy clustering and supervised machine learning techniques to country sustainability assessment. This research tries to extend the previous sustainability assessment systems by the use of these techniques to reveal the relationships between human sustainability, ecological sustainability and overall sustainability performance by discovering the decision rules. The decision rules discovered from the Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation data of 128 countries are used to predict the country sustainability performance. The method proposed in this paper is flexible to accept large number indicators of sustainability to be used in the assessment of countries sustainability. The results of our analysis on countries sustainability data showed that the proposed method has potential to be used as a decision-making tool for sustainability assessment through a large set of indicators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The economic gainful of the country largely join on the crop production quality and quantity. The production profit can be improved by leaf disease detection in correct time. Many image processing methods have been developed for leaf disease detection. Technological improvement allows the task easier and faster at very early stage. Leaf disease is one of the major issue in the agriculture field. The Cotton leaves are affected by the disease named Cercospora, Bacterial blight, Ascochyta blight, and Target spot. General observation by farmers may time consume, expensive and sometimes inaccurate. For this, we introduce Deep Convolutional Neural Network based approach for identifying Cotton leaf diseases automatically. As per our understanding, Deep Convolutional Neural Network is used for the first time to detect cotton leaf disease. We train our data and assess the experimental result which displays the average accuracy of 96 %. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Social influence is referred to as the phenomenon that one's opinions or behaviors be affected by others. Nowadays, the potential impact of social influence analysis (SIA) is significant. For example, SIA applications can include viral marketing, online content recommendation. Convention social influence analysis uses hand-crafted features and requires domain expert knowledge. Such an approach is not scalable and introduces a high cost. To overcome these disadvantages, deep learning based approaches was introduced. One of the most recent approaches is DeepInf, which is an end-to-end framework for predicting social influence by learning user's latent features. We extended DeefInf in the current paper by integrating teleport probability \alpha from the domain of page rank into the graph convolution network (GCN) model to enhance the performance. Furthermore, we also propose an algorithm called hybrid personalized propagation of neural predictions (HPPNP), which shows an impressive performance in terms of prediction accuracy compared to existing methods. We reused the datasets from DeepInf and performed extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, DIGG datasets. By optimally sampling the teleport probability \alpha, the experimental results show that our model performs the best when compared with existing methods on different datasets. These results demonstrates the effectiveness of our enhanced personalized DeepInf-namely, HPPNP-in social influence prediction via both deep and transfer learning. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={At present, due to the unavailability of natural resources, society should take the maximum advantage of data, information, and knowledge to achieve sustainability goals. In today's world condition, the existence of humans is not possible without the essential proliferation of plants. In the photosynthesis procedure, plants use solar energy to convert into chemical energy. This process is responsible for all life on earth, and the main controlling factor for proper plant growth is soil since it holds water, air, and all essential nutrients of plant nourishment. Though, due to overexposure, soil gets despoiled, so fertilizer is an essential component to hold the soil quality. In that regard, soil analysis is a suitable method to determine soil quality. Soil analysis examines the soil in laboratories and generates reports of unorganized and insignificant data. In this study, different big data analysis machine learning methods are used to extracting knowledge from data to find out fertilizer recommendation classes on behalf of present soil nutrition composition. For this experiment, soil analysis reports are collected from the Tata soil and water testing center. In this paper, Mahoot library is used for analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), artificial neural network (ANN) performance on Hadoop environment. For better performance evaluation, we also used single machine experiments for random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors K-NN, regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM) using polynomial function, SVM using radial basis function (RBF) methods. Detailed experimental analysis was carried out using overall accuracy, AUC-ROC (receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC)) curve, mean absolute prediction error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) validation measurements on soil reports dataset. The results provide a comparison of solution classes and conclude that the SGD outperforms other approaches. Finally, the proposed results support to select the solution or recommend a class which suggests suitable fertilizer to crops for maximum production. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Cities face significant challenges in moving forward with sustainable development. Examples of such challenges are the conflict between economic growth and shortage of natural resources, the depletion of energy and the drastic reduction of environmental carrying capacity. This study evaluates the state of sustainable development and varying trends from 1994 to 2014 in the first-tier Chinese city of Tianjin. A host of sustainability indicators are investigated, including ecological footprint (EF), ecological capacity (EC), ecological deficit (ED)/surplus, optimum population size, EF of 104-yuan Gross National Product (GDP) and EF diversity (EFD). These indicators provide complete insights into the state and trend of urban sustainability. This study proposes a novel prediction model with improved precision based on artificial neural networks. Using the model, this study predicted the EF and EC for Tianjin between 2015 and 2030. Finding yielded the following observations within this period. The total EF increased significantly from 1.17 gha/cap (global hectare/capita) to 3.09 gha/cap, which is virtually a threefold increase. Pasture land, fishing grounds, built-up land and forest land accounted for a small proportion of the total EF, whereas those of fossil energy land and arable land were large. The total EC indicated a slight decrease from 0.27 gha/cap to 0.21 gha/cap. The ECs of pasture land, forest land and fishing grounds were relatively small, whereas those of arable land and built-up land were large. The total ED increased significantly from −0.2632 gha/cap to −3.0511 gha/cap, which indicates that the ecological resource endowments of Tianjin are insufficient to sustain human activities. The optimum population increased by 95.84%, which added from 7.22 × 106 to 14.14 × 106, while the actual population is consistently on overload. The EF of 104-yuan GDP and ecological footprint diversity had a downward trend, indicating the growing efficiency of resource utilisation. This paper proposes tenable suggestions for the progress of urban sustainability. Predictions of the autoregressive integrated moving average and back-propagation neural network models indicate the deterioration in the ecological balance of Tianjin will continue in the short- and mid-term unless effective measures are taken. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid method for online reviews analysis through multi-criteria decision-making, text mining and predictive learning techniques to find the relative importance of factors affecting travelers' decision-making in selecting green hotels with spa services. The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Most studies focused on the introduction of new technologies have not investigated the psychological factors affecting the willingness to use them or conducted empirical studies to explore whether willingness and actual construction safety knowledge-sharing behavior are associated with fewer construction incidents. We conducted face-to-face and LinkedIn open-ended interviews as well as a global survey to study the willingness and actual behavior to share construction knowledge via social software Web 2.0, Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile apps. Then, the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) for willingness and actual knowledge-sharing behavior, as well as the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network were used to illustrate the effect of various factors on predicting the willingness to share knowledge viaWeb 2.0, mobile apps and IoT. Results of the interviews found that practitioners use IoT for knowledge sharing, mainly because they do not want to fall behind the curve. PLS-SEM and MLP revealed that practitioners share construction safety knowledge are not driven by safety-related reasons such as safety awareness enhancement but perceived organization support from their companies. Employees who agree that their organization cared about their employees' well-being was the strongest predictor in influencing people's decision to use tools for knowledge sharing. Moreover, many respondents claimed that factors such as monetary rewards have little impact on motivating people to use tools for knowledge sharing. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Current planning and design decision support systems show limitations in the integration of design, science, and computation. Planning support systems with manual design and post-design evaluations impose major challenges in exploring huge design spaces. Generative design systems largely neglect the wicked nature of design problems and lack appropriate representation methods and simulation tools at the urban scale. To tackle those challenges, this research developed a Smart Design framework featuring urban design decision-making reinforced by artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD). The Smart Design framework treats urban design as an emergent pattern formation processes with contextualized and dynamic objectives. The framework integrates design thinking, advanced artificial intelligence search techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms), urban scale performance simulations, and participation to better inform decision-making. Through four major stages, the framework combines the ideas of Science for Design and Design in Science. The significance and potential of the Smart Design framework are demonstrated in an urban design study of Gangnam superblocks in Seoul, South Korea. The study explores sustainable urban forms in the high-density, super-complex, and hyper-consumptive environment of Gangnam, which can also be found in many other Asian contexts. The case study illustrates how the framework identifies design solutions for sustainable city development in the process of participatory decision-making through the co-evolution of design problems and solutions. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Pure air is vital for sustaining human life. Air pollution causes long-term effects on people. There is an urgent need for protecting people from its profound effects. In general, people are unaware of the levels to which they are exposed to air pollutants. Vehicles, burning various kinds of waste, and industrial gases are the top three onset agents of air pollution. Of these three top agents, human beings are exposed frequently to the pollutants due to motor vehicles. To aid in protecting people from vehicular air pollutants, this article proposes a framework that utilizes deep learning models. The framework utilizes a deep belief network to predict the levels of air pollutants along the paths people travel and also a comparison with the predictions made by a feed forward neural network and an extreme learning machine. When evaluating the deep belief neural network for the case study undertaken, a deep belief network was able to achieve a higher index of agreement and lower RMSE values.

As initial conditions offered to WWTPs, influent conditions (ICs) affect treatment units states, ongoing processes mechanisms, and product qualities. Anomalies in ICs, often raised by abnormal events, need to be monitored and detected promptly to improve system resilience and provide smart environments. This paper proposed and verified data-driven anomaly detection approaches based on deep learning methods and clustering algorithms. Combining both the ability to capture temporal auto-correlation features among multivariate time series from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and the function to delineate complex distributions from restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), RNN-RBM models were employed and connected with various classifiers for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of RNN based, RBM based, RNN-RBM based, or standalone individual detectors, including expectation maximization clustering, K-means clustering, mean-shift clustering, one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), spectral clustering, and agglomerative clustering algorithms were evaluated by importing seven years ICs data from a coastal municipal WWTP where more than 150 abnormal events occurred. Results demonstrated that RNN-RBM-based OCSVM approach outperformed all other scenarios with an area under the curve value up to 0.98, which validated the superiority in feature extraction by RNN-RBM, and the robustness in multivariate nonlinear kernels by OCSVM. The model was flexible for not requiring assumptions on data distribution, and could be shared and transferred among environmental data scientists. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article proposes the creation of a course based on a series of practical sessions, where the students have to develop their practical knowledge about artificial intelligence techniques, specifically multilayer perceptron. The novelty of this paper is based on the constructivism methodology regarding artificial intelligence and sustainable development. Moreover, it can be implemented in different majors because of the flexibility in certain aspects. It is oriented to evaluate skills in the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context. The proposal helps the students to turn theoretical concepts into more tangible objects where they can build their knowledge by programming their implementations in software. Then, programming codes for practicing the neural networks theory, finite impulse response, empirical mode decomposition and discrete wavelet transform are achieved to compare percentage classification between different techniques. Also, it measures the interaction between the student and the theoretical mathematics of artificial intelligence. The continuous evaluations at the end of the practical sessions corroborate the increase in the knowledge of the students. A study based on rubrics illustrates an increase in the average grade obtained by the students in the elaboration of each practice. Finally, a senior project is carried out by taking into account sustainable development issues and the usage of tools of artificial intelligence. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of noise in spa protection areas. Its aim is to determine the delimitation of the areas that exceed a permissible noise level around the sanatorium on the example of a health resort in Inowrocław. The determination of the exceedance of permissible noise levels allows us to develop directly effective local policy tools to be included in planning documents. In order to reduce noise infiltration, it is important to define environmental priorities. Taking into account their impact on the health of users in the protection area, environmental priorities enable us to introduce additional elements to street architecture. In order to properly manage space, in accordance with the idea of sustainable development, zones of environmental sensitivity-and their socio-environmental vulnerability-have been designated for assessing damage (exceeding permissible noise in health facilities) and defining methods of building resilience (proper management). This has provided the basis for a natural balance optimized for the people living in these areas. To achieve the goal above, non-linear support vector machine (SVM) networks were used. This technique allows us to classify the linearly inseparable data and to determine the optimal separation margin. The boundaries of the areas which exceeded permissible noise levels (separation margin) were estimated on the basis of noise pollution maps, created by means of the SVM technique. Thus, the study results in establishing buffer zones where it is possible to use varied land utilization in terms of form and function, as described in the planning documents. Such an activity would limit the spread of noise. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This research is a pioneering study into the adoption of mobile-based money services for financial inclusion and sustainability in developing countries like Togo. Owing to their differences from more usual mobile-based banking and payment services, such technology is being aggressively promoted by providers of network telecommunication companies. However, the factors influencing its sustainable acceptance remain largely unknown. This paper extends the original Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), by integrating self-efficacy (SEMM), technology anxiety (TAMM), and personal innovativeness (PIMM). The research model is assessed with survey data of 539 actual and prospective mobile money users employing structural equation modeling-artificial neural networks (SEM-ANN) approach. A feed-forward-back-propagation (FFBP) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANN with significant predictors obtained from SEM as the input units and the root mean square of errors (RMSE) indicated that the ANN method achieves high prediction accuracy. The results present conclusive evidence that perceived ease-of-use (PEMM) is the most significant factor affecting consumers' attitudes to mobile-based money. While perceived usefulness (PUMM) and PIMM affect adoption decisions, their impact is much lower. Consumer attitudes and intentions were found to have a significant relationship with TAM. SEMM and TAMM; however, they showed mixed results. These findings will be useful to retain prevailing users and attract new ones. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Smart Factory is a complex system that integrates the main elements of the Industry 4.0 concept (e.g., autonomous robots, Internet of Things, and Big data). In Smart Factories intelligent robots, tools, and smart workpieces communicate and collaborate with each other continuously, which results in self-organizing and self-optimizing production. The significance of Smart Factories is to make production more competitive, efficient, flexible and sustainable. The purpose of the study is not only the introduction of the concept and operation of the Smart Factories, but at the same time to show the application of Simulation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in practice. The significance of the study is that the economic and social operational requirements and impacts of Smart Factories are summarized and the characteristics of the traditional factory and the Smart Factory are compared. The most significant added value of the research is that a real case study is introduced for Simulation of the operation of two collaborating robots applying AI. Quantitative research methods are used, such as numerical and graphical modeling and Simulation, 3D design, furthermore executing Tabu Search in the space of trajectories, but in some aspects the work included fundamental methods, like suggesting an original whip-lashing analog for designing robot trajectories. The conclusion of the case study is that-due to using Simulation and AI methods-the motion path of the robot arm is improved, resulting in more than five percent time-savings, which leads to a significant improvement in productivity. It can be concluded that the establishment of Smart Factories will be essential in the future and the application of Simulation and AI methods for collaborating robots are needed for efficient and optimal operation of production processes. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={As the transformative power of AI crosses all economic and social sectors, the use of it as a modern technique for the simulation and/or forecast of various indicators must be viewed as a tool for sustainable development. The present paper reveals the results of research on modeling and simulating the influences of four economic indicators (the production in industry, the intramural research and development expenditure, the turnover and volume of sales and employment) on the evolution of European Economic Sentiment using artificial intelligence. The main goal of the research was to build, train and validate an artificial neural network that is able to forecast the following year's value of economic sentiment using the present values of the other indicators. Research on predicting European Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) using artificial neural networks is a starting point, with work on this subject almost inexistent, the reason being mainly that ESI is a composite of five sectoral confidence indicators and is not thought to be an emotional response to the interaction of the entrepreneurial population with different economic indicators. The authors investigated, without involving a direct mathematical interaction among the indicators involved, predicting ESI based on a cognitive response. Considering the aim of the research, the method used was simulation with an artificial neural network and a feedforward network (structure 4-9-6-1) and a backward propagation instruction algorithm was built. The data used are euro area values (for 19 countries only-EA19) recorded between 1999 and 2016, with Eurostat as the European Commission's statistical data website. To validate the results, the authors imposed the following targets: the result of the neural network training error is less than 5% and the prediction verification error is less than 10%. The research outcomes resulted in a training error (after 30,878 iterations) of less than 0.099% and a predictive check error of 2.02%, which resulted in the conclusion of accurate training and an efficient prediction. AI and artificial neural networks, are modeling and simulation methods that can yield results of nonlinear problems that cover, for example, human decisions based on human cognitive processes as a result of previous experiences. ANN copies the structure and functioning of the biological brain, having the advantage through learning and coaching processes (biological cognitive), to copy/predict the results of the thinking process and, thus, the process of choice by the biological brain. The importance of the present paper and its results stems from the authors' desire to use and popularize modern methods of predicting the different macroeconomic indices that influence the behavior of entrepreneurs and therefore the decisions of these entrepreneurs based on cognitive response more than considering linear mathematical functions that cannot correctly understand and anticipate financial crises or economic convulsions. Using methods such as AI, we can anticipate micro- and macroeconomic developments, and therefore react in the direction of diminishing their negative effects for companies as well as the national economy or European economy. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate whether or not public relations efforts in corporate social responsibility (CSR) influence the news media in corporate crisis situations. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducted a content analysis of press releases and news media based on traditional human-coded cross-lag analyses and a machine learning technique, a novel method of big data analysis to test hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that CSR press releases indeed influenced the news media. During the crisis point, however, agenda-building was not observed. Practical implications: Corporations need to continue CSR activities and provide public relations materials consistently even after a crisis, as an agenda-building role could be recovered. Originality/value: The study examines the relationship between CSR and crisis situations in an agenda-building theoretical framework. The authors introduce agenda-building in the corporate sector with machine learning techniques. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The need to promote a sustainable land management (SLM) approach for land degradation neutrality (LDN) is a global challenge, and we must rely on local assessments of how rural participants are conducting their work. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are as follows: 1) evaluate the fruit culture of the guava producers (Psidium guajava, L.) in Calvillo, Aguascalientes, Mexico; and 2) to show whether it is possible to detect key variables in SLM by using an artificial neural network to improve productivity. The study unit (SU) was located in the community of San Tadeo (21.917 °N and 102.701 °W) in the municipality of Calvillo, Aguascalientes. We considered a total of 430 ha established with this fruit and nine orchards that consisted of 9.05 ha, which is equivalent to 2.09% of the total area. Each hectare was randomly sampled, with a significance of 95% (α ≥ 0.05). The information was collected by using empirical field techniques and a questionnaire sent to the producers. The results revealed that the productive success of the SU is based on the knowledge and ability of the fruit farmers to take advantage of bioclimatic and biophysical conditions for guava cultivation. It was demonstrated in approximately 90% of the analyzed cases that the producer's SLM was between regular and excellent. This result was confirmed by the index of edaphic adequacy (Iea), which was created by nine of thirteen variables measured in the field, that indicated in 47% of the orchards (OR), the edaphic condition is optimum (Iea = 0) or close to optimum (-0.2 ≥ Iea ≤ 0.2). In addition, by using a Multilayer Percetron (MLP), it was possible to detect two key aspects in the producers’ work: cava design (DC) and soil management (SM). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the present research, a methodology is developed to determine the relationship between the variables that define the use of liquefied natural gas in short sea shipping in Europe, through the use of data-mining techniques. The project takes place in the European space, which includes data from 30 countries, the 28 members of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. A Bayesian network is constructed with the 35 indicators selected, which are classified into five different categories: international trade and transport, economy and finance, population and social condition, environment and energy, and institutional and political. It is found that capacity of liquefied natural gas regasification terminals under construction and modal distribution of cargo transport by inland waters are the two root nodes of the network. In addition, the variables of transport and international trade and economy and finance become the most important in the decision to implement liquefied natural gas as marine fuel, while those of environment and energy and population and condition are the most dependent on the network.

abstract={This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent model for the foreign exchange market that is based on the law of supply and demand and includes carry trade, central bank intervention, and macroeconomic fundamentals. With the artificial intelligence method of the unscented Kalman filter, this paper investigates carry traders' expectation formation and risk aversion and the impact of their activities on the movement of the Chinese yuan exchange rate and on the efficiency of central bank intervention. The findings demonstrate that carry traders' activities are partially responsible for fluctuations in the Chinese yuan exchange rate; carry traders behave with obvious risk aversion; their activities tend to weaken the ability of the central bank to intervene in China's foreign exchange market; and the volatility of the Chinese yuan exchange rate and the weight of carry traders are negatively related. Based on these empirical results, specific suggestions for exploring sustainable financial resources are provided. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Incorporating substantial, sustainable development issues into teaching and learning is the ultimate task of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The purpose of our study was to identify the confused students who had failed to master the skill(s) given by the tutors as homework using the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). We have focused ASSISTments, an ITS in this study, and scrutinized the skill-builder data using machine learning techniques and methods. We used seven candidate models including: Naïve Bayes (NB), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Logistic Regression (LR), Deep Learning (DL), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost). We trained, validated, and tested learning algorithms, performed stratified cross-validation, and measured the performance of the models through various performance metrics, i.e., ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Sensitivity, and Specificity. We found RF, GLM, XGBoost, and DL were high accuracy-achieving classifiers. However, other perceptions such as detecting unexplored features that might be related to the forecasting of outputs can also boost the accuracy of the prediction model. Through machine learning methods, we identified the group of students that were confused when attempting the homework exercise, to help foster their knowledge and talent to play a vital role in environmental development. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The world economy is currently becoming involved into a most dangerous crisis of systemic nature: into the transition from postindustrial type economy to post-economy of artificial intelligence (AI). The portent to such a "transition crisis" manifests itself in the fact that the wage level has become stable in all industrially developed countries, however, the center of revolutionary qualitative change has by now shifted to a change of the employment structure – the proportion of less qualified workers group keeps decreasing, what is more, exponentially. Meanwhile, bearing in mind that live labor is the major source of increment of national wealth in sustainable postindustrial economy, it can be stated that it has reached the limit of its constructive capacities and urgently demands bringing the "personal factor" of production beyond boundaries of the latter. It is "post-economy of artificial intelligence" that is up to this imperative. It is characterized by the priority of the new source of energy and social communicating technology, it forms a brand-new economic basis which exceeds the potential of postindustrial production. What actually happens is the transition from the "economy of scarcity" to the "economy of abundance". This entails new architectonics of a social order. In post-economy of artificial intelligence, software-controlled production, service and transaction structures gain the global nature initially. As a result, "artificial intelligence" appears to be the creative software. In the new situation, the emergence of more complicated forms of economy is inevitable. Market institutions – competition, innovation, marketability – will be put to comprehensive tests too. A bunch of theoretical questions arise that can be answered by the economic science. It is searching for answers to the set questions that is in the focus of attention of this paper. © 2018 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.},

abstract={While ‘sustainability’ in management education is mostly addressed from a technical perspective, the emotional and ‘being’ aspects can be key for creating a new mindset. In this paper the authors build on a conceptual model for developing a sustainability mindset, and provide an example of how this was applied in the design of an undergraduate course on Managing Multinationals, at Oulu Business School, the University of Oulu, Finland. Addressing the knowledge, systems thinking, emotional aspects, the tacit paradigms and the values we adhere to, students were led on a journey of discovery that created deep learning. This paper shows how the model for developing a sustainability mindset can be adapted and tailored to specific pedagogical contexts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In coal-fired power plants, it is critical to improve the operational efficiency of boilers for sustainability. In this work, we formulate real-time boiler control as an optimization problem that looks for the best distribution of temperature in different zones and oxygen content from the flue to improve the boiler's stability and energy efficiency. We employ an efficient algorithm by integrating appropriate machine learning and optimization techniques. We obtain a large dataset collected from a real boiler for more than two months from our industry partner, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is important to location-based social networks (LBSNs) for helping users to explore new places and for helping third-party services to launch targeted advertisements. Discovering effective features or representations from check-in data is the key to POI recommendation. Deep learning is a representation-learning method with multiple levels for discovering intrinsic features to better represent user preferences. We analyzed users’ check-in behavior in detail and developed a deep learning model to integrate geographical and social influences for POI recommendation tasks. We used a semi-restricted Boltzmann machine to model the geographical similarity and a conditional layer to model the social influence. Experiments with real-world LBSNs showed that our method performed better than other state-of-the-art methods. Theoretically, our study contributes to the effective usage of data science and analytics for social recommender system design. In practice, our results can be used to improve the quality of personalized POI recommendation services for websites and applications. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Knowledge about the future allocation of wind turbines is relevant for assessments of energy markets or necessary grid expansions. In Germany, political decisions drive the allocation together with investment decisions, social rejections, land use planning, regional development and ecological aspects. Taking all influences into account, a standardized multi-criteria optimization problem combining economic suitability, residential burden and site suitability calculates the regional distribution of wind turbines as input for further assessments. By considering the political framework as boundary conditions for the optimization and detailed geographic area suitability factors using a machine learning approach as input parameters, it is possible to assess effects of regulatory restrictions on regional developments. We use a backtesting for validation and weighting of the objectives.

abstract={Increasingly popular virtualized healthcare services such as online health consultations have significantly changed the way in which health information is sought, and can alleviate geographic barriers, time constraints, and medical resource shortage problems. These online patient-doctor communications have been generating abundant amounts of healthcare-related data. Medical entity extraction from these data is the foundation of medical knowledge discovery, including disease surveillance and adverse drug reaction detection, which can potentially enhance the sustainability of healthcare. Previous studies that focus on health-related entity extraction have certain limitations such as demanding tough handcrafted feature engineering, failing to extract out-of-vocabulary entities, and being unsuitable for the Chinese social media context. Motivated by these observations, this study proposes a novel model named CNMER (Chinese Medical Entity Recognition) using deep neural networks for medical entity recognition in Chinese online health consultations. The designed model utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields as the basic architecture, and uses character embedding and context word embedding to automatically learn effective features to recognize and classify medical-related entities. Exploiting the consultation text collected from a prevalent online health community in China, the evaluation results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the related state-of-the-art models that focus on the Chinese medical entity recognition task. We expect that our model can contribute to the sustainable development of the virtualized healthcare industry. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={This study investigates how the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is perceived by the students enrolled in technical and humanistic specializations at two universities in Timisoara. It has an emphasis on identifying their attitudes towards the phenomenon, on the connotations associated with it, and on the possible impact of artificial intelligence on certain areas of the social life. Moreover, the present study reveals the students' perceptions on the sustainability of these changes and developments, and therefore aims to reduce the possible negative impact on consumers, and at anticipate the changes that AI will produce in the future. In order to collect the data, the authors have used a quantitative research method. A questionnaire-based sociological survey was completed by 928 students, with a representation error of only ±3%. The analysis has shown that a great number of respondents have a positive attitude towards the emergence of AI, who believe it will influence society for the better. The results have also underscored underlying differences based on the respondents' type of specialization (humanistic or technical), and their gender. © 2018 by the author.},

abstract={The Chinese retail industry is expected to grow dramatically over the next few years, owing to the rapid increase in purchasing power of Chinese consumers. Retail managers should analyze the market demands and avoid dull sales to promote the sustainable development of the retail industry. Economic sustainability in the retail industry, which refers to a suitable return of investment, requires the implementation of precise product allocation strategies in different regions. This study proposed a hybrid model to evaluate economic sustainability in the preparation of goods of retail shops on the basis of market demand evaluation. Through a grid-based convolutional neural network, a regression model was first established to model the relationship between consumer distribution and the potential market demand. Then, another model was proposed to evaluate the sustainability among regions based on their supply-demand analysis. An experiment was conducted based on the actual sales data of retail shops in Guiyang, China. Results showed an immense diversity of sustainability in the entire city and three classes of regions were distinguished, namely, high, moderate, and limited. Our model was proven to be effective in the sustainability evaluation of supply and demand in the retail industry after validation showed that its accuracy reached 92.8%. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Various researchers have explored the adverse effects of walled buildings on human health. However, few of them have examined the relationship between walled buildings and private housing estates in Hong Kong. This study endeavors to fill the research gap by exploring the connections among walled-building effects, housing features, macroeconomic factors, and housing prices in private housing estates. Specifically, it reveals the relationship between walled buildings and housing prices. Eight privately owned housing estates are selected with a total of 11,365 observations. Results are analyzed to study the factors that affect the housing price. Firstly, unit root tests are carried out to evaluate if the time series variables follow the unit root process. Secondly, the relationship between walled buildings and housing price is examined by conducting an artificial neural network. We assumed that the housing price reduces due to walled-building effects, given that previous literature showed that heat island effect, and blockage of natural light and views, are common in walled-building districts. Moreover, we assume that housing price can also be affected by macroeconomic factors and housing features, and these effects vary among private housing estates. We also study these impacts by using the two models. Recommendations and possible solutions are suggested at the end of the research paper. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an important issue for organization due to the increasing attention of the firm responsibility to their stakeholders. Most of the literature in this area attempt to use statistical method to investigate the relationship of CSR to various firm performance indexes such as stock price, cost of capital, and return on asset. However, most of the works have low adjusted R square value due to the complexity of problem which leads to validity of the conclusion derived from that model. This paper presents the application of artificial neural network (ANN), one of the machine learning tools capable of modeling complex and non-linear relationship between variables. In this work, data from Thai companies listed in Market for Alternative Investment (mai) were used to train ANN. The trained ANN achieved significantly high adjusted R square value comparing with the statistical method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a significant increase in the use of AI technologies. Many experts are researching and developing AI technologies in their respective fields, often submitting papers and patent applications as a result. In particular, owing to the characteristics of the patent system that is used to protect the exclusive rights to registered technology, patent documents contain detailed information on the developed technology. Therefore, in this study, we propose a statistical method for analyzing patent data on AI technology to improve our understanding of sustainable technology in the field of AI. We collect patent documents that are related to AI technology, and then analyze the patent data to identify sustainable AI technology. In our analysis, we develop a statistical method that combines social network analysis and Bayesian modeling. Based on the results of the proposed method, we provide a technological structure that can be applied to understand the sustainability of AI technology. To show how the proposed method can be applied to a practical problem, we apply the technological structure to a case study in order to analyze sustainable AI technology. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Currently, the debate on the similarities between Islamic and conventional financial products has shifted to a more fundamental question - how does Islamic finance contribute to promoting welfare, building social-cohesion, and realizing social justice as an ultimate goal of Islamic economics? Abu Zaharah (1997) classifies the main objectives of Islamic laws into three categories: educating people, establishing justice, and promoting welfare. Many Islamic scholars are concerned about the so-called Maqasid al-Shari’ah Index as a socio-economic mixture based index to measure the Islamic bank’s performance comprehensively reflected in financial, social, material, and spiritual aspects. Imam Satibi is a well-known Islamic scholar who initially explains the Maqasid al-Shari’ah as a clear vision in practicing Islamic law. Maqasid al-Shari’ah reflects the holistic view of Islam which has to be looked at as a whole not in parts as Islam is a complete and integrated code of life and its goal encompasses the whole life, individual, and society, in this world and the Hereafter (Abozaid and Dusuki, 2007). According to Imam Satibi, there are five main objectives of practicing Islamic law: safeguarding the value of faith, rights and stake-holding, self, intellect, and social entity. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Yasushi Suzuki and Mohammad Dulal Miah; individual chapters, the contributors.},

abstract={China has experienced a continuous and rapid development in urban rail transit (URT) in recent years. However, many problems have occurred in the process of construction and operation, creating bottlenecks for the sustainable development of an URT system. In addition, the components of this system, metro, tram, and maglev, require various capital investments, and their impacts on the environment and land utilization are also different. In this paper, a series of evaluation parameters are selected from the sustainable development perspective. Then a three-layer evaluation index system is established. Next, a wavelet neural network method is applied in evaluating sustainable development of URT lines. Beijing MTR Line 4, Zhangjiang Tram in Shanghai, and Changsha Low-speed Maglev Line are selected as examples. According to the wavelet neural network method, three evaluation values of sustainable URT development have been obtained. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.},

abstract={The non-revenue water (NRW) ratio in a water distribution system is the ratio of the loss due to unbilled authorized consumption, apparent losses and real losses to the overall system input volume (SIV). The method of estimating the NRWratio by measurement might not work in an area with no district metered areas (DMAs) or with unclear administrative district. Through multiple regression analyses is a statistical analysis method for calculating the NRW ratio using the main parameters of the water distribution system, although its disadvantage is lower accuracy than that of the measured NRW ratio. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to estimate the NRWratio. The results of the study proved that the accuracy of NRWratio calculated by the ANN model was higher than by multiple regression analysis. The developed ANN model was shown to have an accuracy that varies depending on the number of neurons in the hidden layer. Therefore, when using the ANN model, the optimal number of neurons must be determined. In addition, the accuracy of the outlier removal condition was higher than that of the original data used condition. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Sustainability of processes or systems is generally evaluated with metrics or indicators. When a set of indicators is identified for a particular system of study, it is important to ensure that all the indicators are necessary and sufficient in defining system sustainability. The indicators should be able to distinguish sustainable process options from unsustainable ones. Generally, a large number of indicators are used to characterize a system. While some of the indicators are essential sustainable indicators, they may not be relevant in defining the particular system of interest. It is essential to select the most important indicators from a large set so that reduced set of indicators can enhance the generalized performance of sustainable process selection algorithm. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning algorithms including k-means clustering for sustainable process selection and support vector machine recursive feature elimination algorithm (SVM-RFE) for relevant indicator identification that is important in sustainable process classification from a group of competing process options. The method is based on weight vector derivatives or generalized error bound sensitivity with respect to each indicator. The proposed method of relevant indicator selection is compared with previous work on important indicator identification using partial least square-variable importance in projection (PLS-VIP) method. We have used two case studies to demonstrate the methodologies. While the PLS-VIP method was successful in identifying indicators that are sufficient for finding relative importance of different process options, SVM-RFE method is useful for identifying indicators that are sufficient in sustainable process classification. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The proposed research helps to associate the risk and return relationship of selected social responsible investing funds. The various forecasting methods are used to evaluate the significance of the social responsible investing funds for the investors. In the present study, information criterion model is used to determine risk and return which is a good predictor model for social responsible investing funds. In particular, the article uses the artificial neural network approach which helps to recognize the risk and return patterns of the social responsible investing funds. For the present study, secondary data had been collected in which the net asset values (NAV) of TATA ethical funds and UTI Charitable and Religious Trust and Registered Society (UTI CRTS) funds are collected from June 2013 to June 2016 to assess the risk and return relationship of selected social responsible investing funds for the investors. It was found that there is a positive relationship between risk and return. All the forecasting models regression, autoregressive integrated moving average, information criterion and artificial neural network are appropriate for depicting the significant relationship, impact and errors between risk and return values. © 2017, © 2017 Management Development Institute.},

abstract={Objectives:: The Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole has begun using machine learning forecasts to help inform parole release decisions. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the forecasts on those decisions and subsequent recidivism. Methods:: A close approximation to a natural, randomized experiment is used to evaluate the impact of the forecasts on parole release decisions. A generalized regression discontinuity design is used to evaluate the impact of the forecasts on recidivism. Results:: The forecasts apparently had no effect on the overall parole release rate, but did appear to alter the mix of inmates released. Important distinctions were made between offenders forecasted to be re-arrested for nonviolent crime and offenders forecasted to be re-arrested for violent crime. The balance of evidence indicates that the forecasts led to reductions in re-arrests for both nonviolent and violent crimes. Conclusions:: Risk assessments based on machine learning forecasts can improve parole release decisions, especially when distinctions are made between re-arrests for violent and nonviolent crime. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper uses formal concept analyses (FCA) and qualitative data points obtained from City Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) to identify expected economic opportunities, the types of urban sustainability development incentives, emissions reduction activities, and methodologies/guidelines adopted for the on-going implementation of the urban sustainability development initiatives. Our focus is on three continents namely Europe, Asia, and North America. A “deep” learning perspective is used to evaluate textual data with depth of up to four layers. Association rules and concept lattice generation functions of FCA are employed and applied to support the learning process. Our empirical models show that the transportation sector is the focal point to reduce emissions in all the three continents. No trend was observed with respect to the methodologies and guidelines applied. There is a need to work interactively with the four layers of deep learning to establish new rules and guidelines for achieving reduction in emissions and urban sustainability transformations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={What do we need for sustainable artificial intelligence that is not harmful but beneficial human life? This paper builds up the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning from the human's cognitive learning process and firms' open innovation process. It conceptually establishes a direct and autonomous learning interaction model. The key factor of this model is that the process to respond to entries from external environments through interactions between autonomous learning and direct learning as well as to rearrange internal knowledge is incessant. When autonomous learning happens, the units of knowledge determinations that arise from indirect learning are separated. They induce not only broad autonomous learning made through the horizontal combinations that surpass the combinations that occurred in direct learning but also in-depth autonomous learning made through vertical combinations that appear so that new knowledge is added. The core of the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning is the variability of the boundary between proven knowledge and hypothetical knowledge, limitations in knowledge accumulation, as well as complementarity and conflict between direct and autonomous learning. Therefore, these should be considered when introducing the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning into navigations, cleaning robots, search engines, etc. In addition, we should consider the relationship between direct learning and autonomous learning when building up open innovation strategies and policies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Accurate weather information is required to assess the performance of sustainable buildings. Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. TMY3 is the latest TMY file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, TMY3 data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961-2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current TMY3 data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over TMY3 direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Relations between and changeability of goal orientation and learning behavior have been studied in several domains and contexts. To alter the adopted goal orientation into a mastery orientation and increase a concomitant deep learning in international business students, a sustainable feedback intervention study was carried out. Sustainable feedback implies acknowledgment of students’ need to be actively involved in their own feedback process. First, relations between and changeability of the concepts found in previous research were validated. Second, the effects of the sustainable feedback intervention were analyzed. Although sustainable feedback helped mastery-oriented learners maintain deep learning, it did not directly influence their goal orientations. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This chapter uses a generic framework for deep learning to help evaluate how one such higher education program located at Worcester Polytechnic Institute fits this framework. Data on learning outcomes provides quantitative support from sustainability-related, community-based projects conducted on an international level. The use of such projects dealing with sustainability issues both locally and globally is detailed with potential application to similar programs as part of a sustainability education curriculum. This analysis provides an opportunity to identify and characterize community-based sustainability projects and their contribution to higher order, integrative, and reflective learning. We present lessons learned and directions for further research with their practical implications. © 2015 William G.O'Brien Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This chapter considers the University of Waterloo's Master of Environment and Business (MEB) program in relation to seven characteristics of deep learning. The MEB program is an executive education program that is mostly delivered online. Student survey responses show a high satisfaction with the program and highlight areas where deep learning is occurring. This chapter emphasizes that it possible to ensure deep learning in an online program and in a program's design (not just at the teaching activity/ assignment level). The chapter ends by offering lessons learned for other online courses and programs. © Peter Lang GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The construction of sustainability performance indicators with using neural networks is an appropriate path to measuring and optimizing sustainable corporate performance. It is described in the paper as a modern method of implementation of artificial intelligence methods. The potential of neural networks is presented in the field of the adaptation of the various company characteristics. There are discussed two nontrivially calculated indicators: the Economic Value Added (EVA) and the Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI). It is known that is sufficient to have the basis of knowledge of several samples, without the knowledge of the internal links, for neural network modelling. The user friendly mathematical software Maple is introduced for the solution of those tasks. Maple has become the strong computational tool of mathematical, financial and economic modelling in education, research and practice. It allows implementing the appropriate neural network, which would be used by company managers while maintaining the complexity of values and meaningful indicators of economic performance to remove their discovered disadvantage.},

abstract={This paper provides and illustrates a generic framework for deep learning in a Sustainability-based course for higher education instruction. The use of Sustainability Consulting Projects is detailed with potential application to similar programs as part of their Sustainable Education curriculum. Using four disparate institutions of higher learning across the eastern coast of the United States we can complete an exploratory analysis of the framework. This analysis will provide us opportunity to identify and characterize community sustainability projects and their contribution to higher order, integrative and reflective learning. This deep learning framework and model will be helpful to curriculum developers and instructors who wish to introduce these types of projects into their courses and curriculum. These processes and tools may be integrated into current Sustainability Management courses or used as the basis for development of specific courses focused specifically on this topic; e.g., Sustainability Consulting or as a capstone course. Lessons learned and framework design and implementation provide opportunities for further research and development of these courses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The feasibility of modeling municipal waste generation (MWG) for countries at different levels of development using artificial neural networks (ANN) and selected generic indicators of sustainability was investigated. The main goals of this research were to develop ANN-based models for predicting MWG, to overcome the problem of incomplete MWG data, which is notable in developing countries, and to provide a new method for the planning of municipal solid waste management systems as well as for the simulation of various other scenarios. Data from 26 European countries was used in this study as training, test and validation datasets for the developing of ANN models. Since this kind of modeling is particularly important for developing countries where MWG data is missing or incomplete, emphasis was placed on modeling of MWG for Bulgaria and Serbia. Based on a comparison of actual MWG data with predictions given by the model, we show that ANNs can be applied successfully to modeling and forecasting MWG on a national scale. Moreover, the scope for possible application of the model is broad, since it uses generic indicators of sustainability such as gross domestic product, domestic material consumption and resource productivity, and performs well for countries with highly diversified levels of economic development, industrial structure, productivity and output. © 2012 Springer.},

abstract={Over the summer's two test structures one with green roofs and other with RCC was built and tested at Sustainable City, Ujjain to determine their cooling potential. Results indicate that the test cell with the green roof consistently performs better than the test cells with the conventional cement RCC roof. The objective of this work is to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn to predict the reduction in heat gain from the roof buildings with the different experimental data. A number of different training algorithms were used to create an ANN model. This study is helpful in finding the thermal comfort and energy saving of building by applying green roof over the roof. The data presented as input were daily Statistics for Dry Bulb temperatures temperature, relative humidity, average solar intensity and wind speed. The network output was reduction in heat gain from roof. The advantages of this approach compared to the conventional algorithmic methods are (i) the speed of calculation, (ii) the simplicity, (iii) adaptive learning from examples and thus gradually improve its performance, (iv) self-organization, (v) real time operation. ANN gives satisfactory results with deviation of 4.7% and successful prediction rate of 93.8-98.5%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A need for incorporating sustainability requirements during product development phase so as to ensure green initiatives is the vital focus of today's industries. However, proposed approaches are lacking in terms of sustainability aspects and difficulty in selecting the most sustainable product assembly model at the end of the methodologies. Besides, useful tools such as life-cycle assessment (LCA), streamlined LCA and environmental matrix for assessing the environmental impacts associated with a product have been incorporated in order to fulfil those limitations but the variation in price and complexity makes it difficult to match the goal, scope and budget of the product design. Therefore, this study presents an integrated morphological analysis theory and artificial neural network approach for producing products in sustainable manner that caters to environment, economic and social aspects. As a result from the case study, the most sustainable of new portable vacuum cleaner models can be systematically selected. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},
